      <title>Obama's 'apology' complex</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/obama-asia-trip-hiroshima-apology-223446</link>
      <description>Why this president sees himself as a force for confronting complicated truths about the past.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;HANOI, Vietnam — He’s not sorry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven years after kicking off his presidency with a famous speech in Cairo reaching out to the Arab world, but that skipped Israel, Barack Obama is about to bookend it with one of his last big trips on Air Force One, landing first here in Vietnam before going on to Hiroshima, Japan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama’s critics call stops like this an apology tour. He and his White House aides call it “reckoning with history.” Some prefer “coming to grips with history.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These trips are deliberate, ordered up by a president whose foreign policy has been shaped by a sense of himself as a catalyst forcing the world to deal with the past in order to deal with the future, according to current and former officials close to the president. He’s going to Vietnam to deal with China, and he’s going to Hiroshima to deal with North Korea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the first stop, the president will encounter the remnants of the Vietnam War as well as the country’s postwar insularity and communism. Then, in Japan, he’ll use the backdrop of Hiroshima’s famous bombed-out dome to urge people not to think that nuclear weapons exist only in black-and-white photos. The latter is a portrait of the American military at its mightiest, the former a portrait of the American military at its least effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip to Vietnam has long been in the works — but not nearly as long as the trip to Hiroshima has been kicking around. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From the beginning of this presidency, we were told the president has an interest” in coming, said Kenichirō Sasae, Japan’s ambassador to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Hiroshima, Obama will spend two days in central Japan attending his last meeting of the G-7, where he’ll be one of the most senior world leaders around the table, behind only German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Now, near the end of two full terms, he’s been president longer than all but 13 of his predecessors, and all but six since the beginning of the 20th century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Obama still arrives at decisions relying on his own internal sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s probably one of the most inexperienced presidents we’ve had,” said Obama’s former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who enthusiastically supports this trip. “He’s driven a lot by his own intuition, his own instincts, his own intellect. He’ll listen to people, and he likes to, but he’s driven by his instincts.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, top aides acknowledged they’d warned Obama he would create an unnecessary problem for himself by making such a naked appeal to the Arab world in his Cairo speech, but that he’d insisted on going through with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, current and former aides say, Obama knows the usual suspects are going to smack him with the apology tour line that is always part of the conversation: “He’s a person who got elected twice with majorities — he’s pretty politically attuned,” said his former national security adviser, Tom Donilon, but that almost encourages him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of these steps he takes are without pretty serious thought, and they are the result of long efforts,” Donilon said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the trip to Vietnam is less of a breakthrough event, since Bill Clinton and George W. Bush each made their own journeys to the scene of what was the United State’s longest war before Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama will visit some sites associated with the conflict, but he won’t be participating in a search for MIAs, as Clinton did in 2000 (a search that, amazingly, became a success, finding the remains of an airman whose son was part of the official delegation). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama is here less to remember the helicopter taking off from the roof of the American Embassy in 1975 than to reward the current Vietnamese government for the dozens of new laws passed to comply with the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal — including allowing labor unions and workplace protections. The calculation isn’t complicated: The more Obama gets Vietnam and other nations on board with his diplomatic “pivot to Asia” and plans for greater economic cooperation, the less room China will dominate the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all the years that Obama has been thinking about visiting Hiroshima, the particulars of the trip were still in flux as he prepared to fly across the Pacific, with aides ducking questions about what exactly Obama would do on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama will visit the memorial to the bombing, and he’ll speak, but whether that will be a speech or just remarks that don’t require a teleprompter, the White House wouldn’t specify as he prepared to leave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, White House aides have been batting away the same question in the weeks since word of the Hiroshima trip started leaking : No, no, no, he won’t use the word “sorry,” they say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We said that this is not about issuing an apology,” Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes on Thursday told reporters preparing to go on the trip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the assurances haven’t succeeded in settling suspicions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The president needs to be very careful with the words he uses. There is no real apology for what we did,” said Zalmay Khalilzad, George W. Bush’s final ambassador to the United Nations. “I have no problem with going there. It’s what he says there that’s tricky.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodes said the message of the trip is “that leaders and citizens have to be mindful going forward about the enormous cost of war, and that we can never forget the toll that war takes on innocent life,” and also, “as we get farther and farther away from the use of nuclear weapons, that we not lose urgency in seeking to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and seeking to reduce nuclear stockpiles, and ultimately pursue a world without them.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s less about Obama bragging again about his Iran deal or acknowledging his failure to live up to his 2009 speech in Prague calling for an end to nuclear proliferation. It’s about North Korea — which supporters and critics agree is a situation that Obama’s preparing to leave office with in worse shape, closer to the edge and without much to claim progress out of despite the years of multilateral talks he’s tried to quarterback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t really been successful in stopping all this North Korean movement,” Sasae acknowledged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why South Korea, though not part of Obama’s itinerary or meetings, is cheering the Hiroshima visit — not because he might stop by the cenotaph at the site to mark the estimated 45,000 Koreans who were among the 400,000 killed as the Enola Gay flew away, but in the hopes Obama’s visit will be what a South Korean official expressed hope would be “a signal to North Korea against its nuclear ambitions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, once North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un gets a nuclear weapon to work, Seoul is an easy target, and once he gets the ICBMs set, Guam and other American territory will be within range too, and no one has yet seen reason to believe he’ll proceed cautiously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is getting people to think about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a bit of a memory problem here,” Donilon said. “For you, for me, this is a historical issue. There are not a lot of people left for whom it isn’t. To underscore the stakes, to go at this moment, I think, is an important part of his presidency.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Obama's Asian nuclear nightmare</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/obama-nuke-223412</link>
      <description>Fueled by Trump's rhetoric and North Korea's threats, Japan and South Korea are eyeing nuclear weapons of their own.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama's trip to Asia next week will be anchored by a stop in Hiroshima, where he will focus on its dark nuclear past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Obama’s visit comes at a moment when U.S. and Asian officials fear the region is entering a newly dangerous atomic future, threatening Obama’s vow to roll back the spread of nuclear arms and possibly touching off an Asian nuclear arms race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Korea is expanding its nuclear arsenal and upgrading its ballistic missiles. China is growing and modernizing its stockpile. Most strikingly, Pentagon planners worry that Japan and South Korea might for the first time explore developing nuclear arms of their own — promoted in part by the recent conclusion by U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies that North Korea’s bizarre regime can now mount a small nuclear warhead on missiles capable of striking Japan and South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there is Donald Trump, who recently questioned one of Asia’s core security assumptions: a nuclear-weapons free Japan. “Wouldn’t you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?” Trump asked in a March New York Times interview. Seared by the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan has forsworn nuclear weapons since World War II, though it runs a nuclear energy program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama’s visit Friday to Hiroshima, which was incinerated by a U.S. atomic bomb in August 1945, will promote a message diametrically opposite from Trump’s. “It’s an opportunity to focus the world’s attention on the need to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and seek a world without them,” said deputy national adviser Ben Rhodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s part of Obama’s broader and long-stated goal of limiting nuclear proliferation — one he has pursued with mixed results. Obama sealed a nuclear deal with Iran that stopped its path to a bomb, for now, and has led efforts to secure loose nuclear material worldwide. But he has not achieved major reductions in the U.S. nuclear arsenal, thanks in part to Russia’s resistance to making comparable cuts. Nor has he slowed dangerous atomic expansions in North Korea and Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after the Iran deal averted what Obama predicted would be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, Asia suddenly looms large as an atomic danger zone. Seemingly immune to sanctions and isolation, North Korea presses on with its weapons program: Recent satellite imagery suggests that North Korea may be building a new tunnel in preparation for its fifth nuclear test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are losing patience with international efforts to thwart Pyongyang’s program. Some suspect China is all too happy with a status quo that keeps North Korea contained and stable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those governments increasingly fret that the U.S., which has protected them for decades under a nuclear umbrella, may become a less reliable ally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is particularly fraught in Japan, which has a post-World War II policy of pacifism enshrined in its constitution. But last year Japan passed legislation reinterpreting its constitution to allow foreign military operations for the first time since World War II, though only ones that are defensive in nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some officials and analysts say the anti-nuclear taboo is also being revisited, especially as China asserts new territorial claims, including over islands and waters claimed by Japan. At the same time, many Japanese leaders feel that Obama has not challenged Beijing forcefully enough. Trump’s suggestion that Japan and South Korea might need to fend for themselves has only exacerbated the concerns that America can no longer be relied on for protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Careless American rhetoric that calls into question America’s security commitment in general and extended nuclear deterrent in particular fuels Tokyo’s security planners to develop hedging strategies,” said Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has often been thought that Japan has a bomb in the basement, and it would just have to assemble the parts to create a bomb,” Cronin added. “The technical challenges might actually be much greater than that, but it is the political hurdles that remain the real barriers to Japan acquiring nuclear weapons.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those barriers, while still high, may be eroding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Trump’s comments in March, for instance, the governor of Japan’s Osaka prefecture told reporters that the country should revisit the question of nuclear weapons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What do we do if America’s military strength [in Japan] disappears?” asked the governor, Ichiro Matsui. “Wishful thinking doesn’t get us anywhere.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Japanese conservatives have made the same argument in recent years, including Shintaro Ishihara, who served as Tokyo’s governor until 2012 and said in 2011 that Japan “should absolutely possess nuclear weapons.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such talk has been striking to Japan experts in the U.S., who have assumed for decades that the country would remain non-nuclear. “Very few except the extreme fringes used to talk about nuclear weapons” in Japan, said Richard Samuels, director of MIT’s Center for International Studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pro-nuclear weapons sentiment in Japan remains mostly on the far right, to be sure. But the same conversation is brewing in South Korea, where a 2013 poll found that two-thirds of South Koreans support developing nukes in response to its bellicose northern neighbor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seoul can no longer sit idly by as the [nuclear] talks lead to no results and Washington and Beijing are busy blaming each other for their diplomatic failures,” argued an editorial in Seoul’s conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such talk “is driven by a deep fear of abandonment” by the U.S., Cronin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama himself was dismissive when asked at an April 1 news conference about Trump’s talk of allowing Japan and South Korea to build their own nuclear weapons, saying they reveal that “Trump doesn’t know much about foreign policy, or nuclear policy, or the Korean Peninsula, or the world generally.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. alliance with Japan and South Korea, he added, “is one of the foundations, one of the cornerstones of our presence in the Asia-Pacific region,” he said, adding that it “has prevented the possibilities of a nuclear escalation” in the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So you don’t mess with that,” Obama said. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>This Is What the Future of American Politics Looks Like</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-election-realignment-partisan-political-party-policy-democrats-republicans-politics-213909</link>
      <description>This year, we’re seeing the end of a partisan realignment, and the beginning of a policy one — and U.S. politics is about to change big-time.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For political observers, 2016 feels like an earthquake&lt;/b&gt; — a once-in-a-generation event that will remake American politics. The Republican party is fracturing around support for Donald Trump. An avowed socialist has made an insurgent challenge for the Democratic Party’s nomination. On left and right, it feels as though a new era is beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a new era &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; beginning, but not in the way most people think. Though this election feels like the beginning of a partisan realignment, it’s actually the end of one. The partisan coalitions that defined the Democratic and Republican parties for decades in the middle of the twentieth century broke apart long ago; over the past half century, their component voting blocs — ideological, demographic, economic, geographic, cultural — have reshuffled. The reassembling of new Democratic and Republican coalitions is nearly finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing this year is the beginning of a policy realignment, when those new partisan coalitions decide which ideas and beliefs they stand for — when, in essence, the party platforms catch up to the shift in party voters that has already happened. The type of conservatism long championed by the Republican Party was destined to fall as soon as a candidate came along who could rally its voters without being beholden to its donors, experts and pundits. The future is being built before our eyes, with far-reaching consequences for every facet of American politics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2016 race is a sign that American politics is changing in profound and lasting ways; by the 2020s and 2030s, partisan platforms will have changed drastically. You may find yourself voting for a party you could never imagine supporting right now. What will that political future look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s Republican Party is predominantly a Midwestern, white, working-class party with its geographic epicenter in the South and interior West. Today’s Democratic Party is a coalition of relatively upscale whites with racial and ethnic minorities, concentrated in an archipelago of densely populated blue cities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both parties, there’s a gap between the inherited orthodoxy of a decade or two ago and the real interests of today’s electoral coalition. And in both parties, that gap between voters and policies is being closed in favor of the voters — a slight transition in the case of Hillary Clinton, but a dramatic one in the case of Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Democratic primary, pundits who focused on the clash between Clinton and Sanders missed a story that illuminated this shift: The failure of Jim Webb’s brief campaign for the presidential nomination. Webb was the only candidate who represented the old-style Democratic Party of the mid-20th century — the party whose central appeal was among white Southerners and Northern white “ethnics.” Even during the “New Democrat” era of Bill Clinton, white working-class remnants of that coalition were still important in the party. But by 2016, Webb lacked a constituency, and he was out of place among the politicians seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, which included one lifelong socialist (Bernie Sanders) and two candidates who had been raised as Republicans (Hillary Clinton and, briefly, Lincoln Chafee).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Republican side, the exemplary living fossil was Jeb Bush. Like his brother, Jeb pushed a neo-Reaganite synthesis of support for a hawkish foreign policy, social conservatism, and cuts in middle-class entitlements to finance further tax cuts for the rich. From the Reagan era until recently, the GOP’s economic policies have been formulated by libertarians, whose views are at odds with those of most Republican voters. In March of this year, &lt;a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/03/31/3-views-on-economy-government-services-trade/" target="_blank"&gt;a Pew Research Center poll&lt;/a&gt; showed that 68 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters opposed future reductions in Social Security benefits — almost the same amount of support found among Democrats and Dem-leaning voters (73 percent). Republicans who supported Trump were even more opposed to Social Security benefit cuts at 73 percent. And even among those who supported Kasich, 62 percent opposed cuts in Social Security benefits — even though Kasich, himself, is in favor of cutting entitlements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As country-and-western Republicans have gradually replaced country-club Republicans, the gap between the party’s economic orthodoxy and the economic interests of white working-class voters in the GOP base and has increased. House Republicans repeatedly have passed versions of Paul Ryan’s budget plan, which is based on cutting Social Security and replacing Medicare with vouchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except for Trump, all of the leading Republican candidates—Cruz, Bush, Rubio, Kasich—favored some version of the Ryan agenda. By contrast, Trump was the only leading GOP candidate who expressed the actual preference of most Republican voters, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/10/politics/republican-debate-transcript-full-text/" target="_blank"&gt;declaring his&lt;/a&gt; “absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and leave it as is.” Trump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Trump is defeated, what is left of the GOP establishment might try to effect a restoration of the old economic dogma of free trade, mass immigration and entitlement cuts. But sooner or later, a Republican party platform with policies that most of the party’s core voters reject will be revised or abandoned—over the objections of libertarian Republican party donors and allied think tanks and magazines, if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why is this all happening now?&lt;/b&gt; Because the decades-long “culture war” between religious conservatives and secular liberals is largely over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most culture-war conflicts involve sexuality, gender,or reproduction (for example, abortion, contraception, LGBT rights, and same-sex marriage). The centrality of culture-war issues in national politics from the 1960s to the present allowed both major parties to contain factions with incompatible economic views. For a generation, the Democratic Party has included both free traders and protectionists — but support for abortion rights and, more recently, gay rights have been litmus tests for Democratic politicians with national ambitions. Conversely, Republicans have been allowed to disagree about trade and immigration, but all Republican presidential candidates have had to pay lip service to repealing &lt;i&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/i&gt; and outlawing abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social issues spurred a partisan realignment by changing who considered themselves Democrats and Republicans. Over decades, socially conservative working-class whites migrated from the Democratic Party to join the Republican Party, especially in the South. Socially moderate Republicans, especially on the East Coast, shifted to the Democratic coalition. Now, there’s little disagreement within each party on social issues. Liberal Republicans are as rare as Reagan Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like an ebb tide that reveals a reshaped coastline, the culture war remade the parties’ membership and is now receding. In its absence, we are able to see a transformed political landscape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culture war and partisan realignment are over; the policy realignment and “border war” — a clash between nationalists, mostly on the right, and multicultural globalists, mostly on the left — and have just begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the nationalists&lt;/b&gt;, the most important dividing line is that between American citizens and everyone else—symbolized by Trump’s proposal for a Mexican border wall. On the right, American nationalism is tainted by strains of white racial and religious nationalism and nativism, reinforced by &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/07/donald-trump-mexicans-119849" target="_blank"&gt;Trump’s incendiary language about Mexicans&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/donald-trump-shutdown-of-muslims-216504" target="_blank"&gt;proposed temporary ban&lt;/a&gt; on Muslims entering the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while there is overlap between nationalists and racists, the two are not the same thing. The most extreme white nationalists don’t advocate nationalism as a governing philosophy in our multiracial country; they hope to withdraw from American life and create a white homeland within the nation-state. Nationalism is different than white nationalism, and a populist American nationalism untainted by vestiges of racial bigotry might have transracial appeal, like versions of national populism in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of populist nationalism on the right is paralleled by the rise of multicultural globalism on the center-left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For multicultural globalists, national boundaries are increasingly obsolete and perhaps even immoral. According to the emerging progressive orthodoxy, the identities that count are subnational (race, gender, orientation) and supranational (citizenship of the world). While not necessarily representative of Democratic voters, progressive pundits and journalists increasingly speak a dialect of ethical cosmopolitanism or globalism — the idea that it is unjust to discriminate in favor of one’s fellow nationals against citizens of foreign countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This difference in worldviews maps neatly into differences in policy. Nationalists support immigration and trade deals only if they improve the living standards of citizens of the nation. For the new, globally minded progressives, the mere well-being of American workers is not a good enough reason to oppose immigration or trade liberalization. It’s an argument that today’s progressive globalists have borrowed from libertarians: immigration or trade that depresses the wages of Americans is still justified if it makes immigrants or foreign workers better off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disagreements within both parties on trade is a living example of the inchoate policy realignment. Every major Republican presidential candidate supported free-trade agreements — with the sole and major exception of Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee, who routinely slams free-trade deals and has called for the reintroduction of certain tariffs on foreign goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the current opposition of many Democratic politicians to free-trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership reflects the residual influence of declining manufacturing unions within the party According to &lt;a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/03/31/3-views-on-economy-government-services-trade/#free-trade-agreements-viewed-positively-by-democratic-voters" target="_blank"&gt;a March 2016 study by the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, by a margin of 56 percent to 38 percent, Democratic voters believe that free-trade agreements have been good for the U.S. Among Republicans, those numbers are almost reversed: by a 53 percent to 38 percent margin, a majority of Republicans believe free-trade has been a bad thing. Among younger Americans, who tend to prefer Democrats to Republicans, support for free trade is high: 67 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds say trade agreements are good for the country. Even progressives who campaign against trade deals feel obliged by the logic of ethical cosmopolitanism to justify their opposition in the name of the labor rights of foreign workers or the good of the global environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next decade or longer, as the parties’ stances adjust, this “border war” that has succeeded the “culture war” will define and remake American politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The outlines of the two-party system&lt;/b&gt; of the 2020s and 2030s are dimly visible. The Republicans will be a party of mostly working-class whites, based in the South and West and suburbs and exurbs everywhere. They will favor universal, contributory social insurance systems that benefit them and their families and reward work effort—programs like Social Security and Medicare. But they will tend to oppose means-tested programs for the poor whose benefits they and their families cannot enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will oppose increases in both legal and illegal immigration, in some cases because of ethnic prejudice; in other cases, for fear of economic competition. The instinctive economic nationalism of tomorrow’s Republicans could be invoked to justify strategic trade as well as crude protectionism. They are likely to share &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-tax/2015/08/trump-hedge-funders-getting-away-with-murder-on-taxes-schumer-touts-solar-investment-in-trip-to-buffalo-revised-cbo-estimate-boosts-numbers-for-obamas-budget-019747" target="_blank"&gt;Trump’s view&lt;/a&gt; of unproductive finance: “The hedge-fund guys didn’t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats of the next generation will be even more of an alliance of upscale, progressive whites with blacks and Latinos, based in large and diverse cities. They will think of the U.S. as a version of their multicultural coalition of distinct racial and ethnic identity groups writ large. Many younger progressives will take it for granted that moral people are citizens of the world, equating nationalism and patriotism with racism and fascism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The withering-away of industrial unions, thanks to automation as well as offshoring, will liberate the Democrats to embrace free trade along with mass immigration wholeheartedly. The emerging progressive ideology of post-national cosmopolitanism will fit nicely with urban economies which depend on finance, tech and other industries of global scope, and which benefit from a constant stream of immigrants, both skilled and unskilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tomorrow’s Republican policymakers will embrace FDR-to-LBJ universal entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, future Democrats may prefer means-tested programs for the poor only. In the expensive, hierarchical cities in which Democrats will be clustered, universal social insurance will make no sense. Payroll taxes on urban workers will be too low to fund universal social insurance, while universal social benefits will be too low to matter to the urban rich. So the well-to-do in expensive, unequal Democratic cities will agree to moderately redistributive taxes which pay for means-tested benefits—perhaps even a guaranteed basic income—for the disproportionately poor and foreign-born urban workforce. As populist labor liberalism declines within the Democratic party, employer-friendly and finance-friendly libertarianism will grow. The Democrats of 2030 may be more pro-market than the Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the two coalitions, which is likely to prevail most of the time? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While progressives claim that nonwhite Americans will become a majority, this is misleading for two reasons. To begin with, &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p25-1143.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, from this point until  2060, there will be only limited growth in the African-American population (a rise from 13.2 percent to 14.3 percent) and the Asian-American population (5.4 percent to 9.3 percent) as shares of the whole. The growth of the nonwhite category by 2060 is driven overwhelmingly by the increasing Latino share of the population, from 17.4 percent to 28.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, Latino Americans increasingly identify themselves as white. Between the 2000 Census and the 2010 Census, &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/2010_census/cb11-cn184.html" target="_blank"&gt;about 7 percent of Hispanics changed their self-description&lt;/a&gt; from “some other race” to “white.” At the same time, according to the Census Bureau, three-fourths of “white population growth” in 21st-century America has been driven by individuals who declared themselves white and of Hispanic origin. If increasing numbers of Hispanics identify as white and their descendants are defined as “white” in government statistics, there may be a white majority in the U.S. throughout the 21st century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More important than unscientific Census classifications will be how the growing Latino population votes. Trump’s unpopularity among Latino voters is likely to help the Democrats in the short run. But Democrats cannot assume they’ll have a solid Latino voting bloc in the future. In Texas, in particular, Republicans have been successful in winning many Latino voters, all the way back to Senator John Tower and Governor George W. Bush. In Texas’ 2014 elections, Republican gubernatorial nominee Greg Abbott won 44 percent of Latino Texans. Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn did even better, with 48 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming decades, it is possible that Latinos will be reliable Democratic voters and condemn the Republican Party to minority status at the presidential level, if not everywhere. But it is also possible that as Latinos assimilate and intermarry, they will move from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party, following a trail blazed in the past by many “white ethnic” voters of European descent, including Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy realignment of the present and near future will complete the partisan realignment of the past few decades. And though it’s impossible to know exactly how it will end, one thing is clear: In 2016, the old political system is crumbling, and a new American political order is being born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Just What Were Donald Trump's Ties to the Mob?</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-mob-organized-crime-213910</link>
      <description>I've spent years investigating, and here's what's known.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In his signature book, &lt;i&gt;The Art of the Deal, &lt;/i&gt;Donald Trump boasted that when he wanted to build a casino in Atlantic City, he persuaded the state attorney general to limit the investigation of his background to six months. Most potential owners were scrutinized for more than a year. Trump argued that he was “clean as a whistle”—young enough that he hadn’t had time to get into any sort of trouble. He got the sped-up background check, and eventually got the casino license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Trump was not clean as a whistle. Beginning three years earlier, he’d hired mobbed-up firms to erect Trump Tower and his Trump Plaza apartment building in Manhattan, including buying ostensibly overpriced concrete from a company controlled by mafia chieftains Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno and Paul Castellano. That story eventually came out in a federal investigation, which also concluded that in a construction industry saturated with mob influence, the Trump Plaza apartment building most likely benefited from connections to racketeering. Trump also failed to disclose that he was under investigation by a grand jury directed by the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, who wanted to learn how Trump obtained an option to buy the Penn Central railroad yards on the West Side of Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did Trump get his casino license anyway? Why didn’t investigators look any harder? And how deep did his connections to criminals really go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions ate at me as I wrote about Atlantic City for &lt;i&gt;The Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/i&gt;, and then went more deeply into the issues in a book, &lt;i&gt;Temples of Chance: How America Inc. Bought Out Murder Inc. to Win Control of the Casino Business.&lt;/i&gt; In all, I’ve covered Donald Trump off and on for 27 years, and in that time I’ve encountered multiple threads linking Trump to organized crime. Some of Trump’s unsavory connections have been followed by investigators and substantiated in court; some haven’t. And some of those links have continued until recent years, though when confronted with evidence of such associations, Trump has often claimed a faulty memory. In an April 27 phone call to respond to my questions for this story, Trump told me he did not recall many of the events recounted in this article and they “were a long time ago.” He also said that I had “sometimes been fair, sometimes not” in writing about him, adding “if I don’t like what you write, I’ll sue you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not the only one who has picked up signals over the years. Wayne Barrett, author of a 1992 investigative biography of Trump’s real-estate dealings, has tied Trump to mob and mob-connected men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other candidate for the White House this year has anything close to Trump’s record of repeated social and business dealings with mobsters, swindlers, and other crooks. Professor Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian, said the closest historical example would be President Warren G. Harding and Teapot Dome, a bribery and bid-rigging scandal in which the interior secretary went to prison. But even that has a key difference: Harding’s associates were corrupt but otherwise legitimate businessmen, not mobsters and drug dealers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is part of the Donald Trump story that few know. As Barrett wrote in his book, Trump didn’t just do business with mobbed-up concrete companies: he also probably met personally with Salerno at the townhouse of notorious New York fixer Roy Cohn, in a meeting recounted by a Cohn staffer who told Barrett she was present. This came at a time when other developers in New York were pleading with the FBI to free them of mob control of the concrete business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the public record and published accounts like that one, it’s possible to assemble a clear picture of what we do know. The picture shows that Trump’s career has benefited from a decades-long and largely successful effort to limit and deflect law enforcement investigations into his dealings with top mobsters, organized crime associates, labor fixers, corrupt union leaders, con artists and even a one-time drug trafficker whom Trump retained as the head of his personal helicopter service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that he’s running for president, I pulled together what’s known – piecing together the long history of federal filings, court records, biographical anecdotes, and research from my and Barrett’s files. What emerges is a pattern of business dealings with mob figures&lt;b&gt;—&lt;/b&gt;not only local figures, but even the son of a reputed Russian mob boss whom Trump had at his side at a gala Trump hotel opening, but has since claimed under oath he barely knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Trump’s campaign spokesperson, Hope Hicks, nor Jason Greenblatt, the executive vice president and chief legal officer at the Trump Organization, responded to several emailed requests for comment on the issues raised in this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, as close as we can get to the truth, is what really happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After graduating in 1968&lt;/b&gt; from the University of Pennsylvania, a rich young man from the outer boroughs of New York City sought his fortune on the island of Manhattan. Within a few years Donald J. Trump had made friends with the city’s most notorious fixer, lawyer Roy Cohn, who had become famous as lead counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy. Among other things Cohn was now a mob consigliere, with clients including “Fat Tony” Salerno, boss of the Genovese crime family, the most powerful Mafia group in New York, and Paul Castellano, head of what was said to be the second largest family, the Gambinos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This business connection&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;proved useful when Trump began work on what would become Trump Tower, the 58-story high-rise where he still lives when he’s not at his Florida estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was something a little peculiar about the construction of Trump Tower, and subsequent Trump projects in New York. Most skyscrapers are steel girder construction, and that was especially true in the 1980s, says John Cross of the American Iron &amp;amp; Steel Institute. Some use pre-cast concrete. Trump chose a costlier and in many ways riskier method: ready-mix concrete. Ready-mix has some advantages: it can speed up construction, and doesn’t require costly fireproofing. But it must be poured quickly or it will harden in the delivery truck drums, ruining them as well as creating costly problems with the building itself. That leaves developers vulnerable to the unions: the worksite gate is union controlled, so even a brief labor slowdown can turn into an expensive disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salerno, Castellano and other organized crime figures controlled the ready-mix business in New York, and everyone in construction at the time knew it. So did government investigators trying to break up the mob, urged on by major developers such as the LeFrak and Resnick families. Trump ended up not only using ready-mix concrete, but also paying what a federal indictment of Salerno later concluded were inflated prices for it – repeatedly – to S &amp;amp; A Concrete, a firm Salerno and Castellano owned through fronts, and possibly to other mob-controlled firms. As Barrett noted, by choosing to build with ready-mix concrete rather than other materials, Trump put himself “at the mercy of a legion of concrete racketeers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salerno and Castellano and other mob families controlled both the concrete business and the unions involved in delivering and pouring it. The risks this created became clear from testimony later by Irving Fischer, the general contractor who built Trump Tower. Fischer said concrete union “goons” once stormed his offices, holding a knife to throat of his switchboard operator to drive home the seriousness of their demands, which included no-show jobs during construction of Trump Tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with Cohn as his lawyer, Trump apparently had no reason to personally fear Salerno or Castellano&lt;b&gt;—&lt;/b&gt;at least, not once he agreed to pay inflated concrete prices. What Trump appeared to receive in return was union peace. That meant the project would never face costly construction or delivery delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment on which Salerno was convicted in 1988 and sent to prison, where he died, listed the nearly $8 million contract for concrete at Trump Plaza, an East Side high-rise apartment building, as one of the acts establishing that S &amp;amp;A was part of a racketeering enterprise. (While the concrete business was central to the case, the trial also proved extortion, narcotics, rigged union elections and murders by the Genovese and Gambino crime families in what Michael Chertoff, the chief prosecutor, called “the largest and most vicious criminal business in the history of the United States.'')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBI agents subpoenaed Trump in 1980 to ask about his dealing with John Cody, a Teamsters official described by law enforcement as a very close associate of the Gambino crime family. The FBI believed that Cody previously had obtained free apartments from other developers. FBI agents suspected that Cody, who controlled the flow of concrete trucks, might get a free Trump Tower apartment. Trump denied it. But a female friend of Cody’s, a woman with no job who attributed her lavish lifestyle to the kindness of friends, bought three Trump Tower apartments right beneath the triplex where Donald lived with his wife Ivana. Cody stayed there on occasion and invested $500,000 in the units. Trump, Barrett reported, helped the woman get a $3 million mortgage without filling out a loan application or showing financials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1982 Cody, then under indictment, ordered a citywide strike—but the concrete work continued at Trump Tower. After Cody was convicted of racketeering, imprisoned and lost control of the union, Trump sued the woman for $250,000 for alteration work. She countersued for $20 million and in court papers accused Trump of taking kickbacks from contractors, asserting this could “be the basis of a criminal proceeding requiring an attorney general’s investigation” into Trump. Trump then quickly settled, paying the woman a half-million dollars. Trump said at the time and since then that he hardly knew those involved and there was nothing improper his dealings with Cody or the woman.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;*** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There were other irregularities&lt;/b&gt; in Trump’s first big construction project. In 1979, when Trump hired a demolition contractor to take down the Bonwit Teller department store to make way for Trump Tower, he hired as many as 200 non-union men to work alongside about 15 members of the House Wreckers Union Local 95. The non-union workers were mostly illegal Polish immigrants paid $4 to $6 per hour with no benefits, far below the union contract. At least some of them did not use power tools but sledgehammers, working 12 hours a day or more and often seven days a week. Known as the “Polish brigade,” many didn’t wear hard hats. Many slept on the construction site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally the use of nonunion workers at a union job site would have guaranteed a picket line. Not at this site, however. Work proceeded because the Genovese family principally controlled the union; this was demonstrated by extensive testimony, documents and convictions in federal trials, as well as a later report by the New York State Organized Crime Task Force. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Polish workers and a union dissident&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;sued for their pay and benefits, Trump denied any knowledge that illegal workers without hard hats were taking down Bonwit with sledgehammers. The trial, however, demonstrated otherwise: Testimony showed that Trump panicked when the nonunion Polish men threatened a work stoppage because they had not been paid. Trump turned to Daniel Sullivan, a labor fixer and FBI informant, who told him to fire the Polish workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump knew the Polish brigade was composed of underpaid illegal immigrants and that S&amp;amp;A was a mob-owned firm, according to Sullivan and others. &amp;quot;Donald told me that he was having his difficulties and he admitted to me that — seeking my advice — that he had some illegal Polish employees on the job. I reacted by saying to Donald that 'I think you are nuts,'&amp;quot; Sullivan testified at the time. &amp;quot;I told him to fire them promptly if he had any brains.&amp;quot; In an interview later, Sullivan told me the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1991, a federal judge, Charles E. Stewart Jr., ruled that Trump had engaged in a conspiracy to violate a fiduciary duty, or duty of loyalty, to the workers and their union and that the “breach involved fraud and the Trump defendants knowingly participated in his breach.” The judge did not find Trump’s testimony to be sufficiently credible and set damages at $325,000. The case was later settled by negotiation, and the agreement was sealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;*** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; While Trump’s buildings were going up in Manhattan,&lt;/b&gt; he was entering a highly regulated industry in New Jersey – one that had the responsibility, and the means, to investigate him and bring the facts to light&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, Trump tried to have it both ways. While he leveraged Roy Cohn’s mob contacts in New York, he was telling the FBI he wanted nothing to do with organized crime in Atlantic City, and even proposed putting an undercover FBI agent in his casinos.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;In April of 1981, when he was considering building a New Jersey casino, he expressed concern about his reputation in a meeting with the FBI, according to an FBI document in my possession and which the site Smoking Gun also posted. “Trump advised Agents that he had read in the press media and had heard from various acquaintances that Organized Crime elements were known to operate in Atlantic City,” the FBI recorded. “Trump also expressed at this meeting the reservation that his life and those around him would be subject to microscopic examination. Trump advised that he wanted to build a casino in Atlantic City but he did not wish to tarnish his family’s name.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the licensing process was supposed to be a deep investigation into his background, taking more than a year for would-be casino owners, but Trump managed to cut that short. As he told the story in &lt;i&gt;The Art of the Deal&lt;/i&gt;, in 1981 he threatened to not build in Atlantic City unless New Jersey’s attorney general, John Degnan, limited the investigation to six months. Degnan was worried that Trump might someday get approval for a casino at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan, which could have crushed Atlantic City’s lucrative gaming industry, so Degnan agreed to Trump’s terms. Trump seemingly paid Degnan back by becoming an ardent foe of gambling anywhere in the East except Atlantic City—a position that obviously protected his newfound business investment as well, of course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump was required to disclose any investigations in which he might have been involved in the past, even if they never resulted in charges. Trump didn’t disclose a federal grand jury inquiry into how he obtained an option to buy the Penn Central railroad yards on the West Side of Manhattan. The failure to disclose either that inquiry or the Cody inquiry probably should have disqualified Trump from receiving a license under the standards set by the gaming authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Trump was licensed in 1982, critical facts that should have resulted in license denial began emerging in Trump’s own books and in reports by Barrett—an embarrassment for the licensing commission and state investigators, who were supposed to have turned these stones over. Forced after the fact to look into Trump’s connections, the two federal investigations he failed to reveal and other matters, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement investigators circled the wagons to defend their work.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;First they dismissed as unreliable what mobsters, corrupt union bosses and Trump’s biggest customer, among others, had said to Barrett, to me and other journalists and filmmakers about their dealings with Trump. The investigators’ reports showed that they then put Trump under oath. Trump denied any misconduct or testified that he could not remember. They took him at his word. That meant his casino license was secure even though others in the gambling industry, including low-level licensees like card dealers, had been thrown out for far less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lapse illustrated a fundamental truth about casino regulation at the time: Once the state licensed an owner, the Division of Gaming Enforcement had a powerful incentive not to overturn its initial judgment. State officials recited like a mantra their promise that New Jersey casinos were the most highly regulated business in American history, more tightly regulated than nuclear power plants. In &lt;i&gt;Temples of Chance&lt;/i&gt; I showed that this reputation often owed less to careful enforcement than to their willingness to look the other way when problems arose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;*** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1986,&lt;/b&gt; three years after Trump Tower opened, Roy Cohn was disbarred for attempting to steal from a client, lying and other conduct that an appellate court found “particularly reprehensible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump testified that Cohn, who was dying from AIDS, was a man of good character who should keep his license to practice law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not the only time Trump went to bat publicly for a criminal.  He has also spoken up for Shapiro and Sullivan. And then there was the case of Joseph Weichselbaum, an embezzler who ran Trump’s personal helicopter service and ferried his most valued clientele. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and Weichselbaum were so close, Barrett reported in his book, that Weichselbaum told his parole officer about how he knew Trump was hiding his mistress, Marla Maples, from his first wife, Ivana, and tried to persuade Trump to end their years-long affair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s casinos retained Weichselbaum’s firm to fly high rollers to Atlantic City. Weichselbaum was indicted in Ohio on charges of trafficking in marijuana and cocaine. The head of one of Trump’s casinos was notified of the indictment in October 1985, but Trump continued using Weichselbaum—conduct that again could have cost Trump his casino license had state regulators pressed the matter, because casino owners were required to distance themselves from any hint of crime. Just two months later Trump rented an apartment he owned in the Trump Plaza apartment building in Manhattan to the pilot and his brother for $7,000 a month in cash and flight services. Trump also continued paying Weichselbaum’s firm even after it went bankrupt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weichselbaum, who in 1979 had been caught embezzling and had to repay the stolen money, pleaded guilty to two felonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump vouched for Weichselbaum before his sentencing, writing that the drug trafficker is “a credit to the community” who was “conscientious, forthright, and diligent.” And while Weichselbaum’s confederates got as many as 20 years, Weichselbaum himself got only three, serving 18 months before he was released from the urban prison that the Bureau of Prisons maintains in New York City. In seeking early release, Weichselbaum said Trump had a job waiting for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weichselbaum then moved into Trump Tower, his girlfriend having recently bought two adjoining apartments there for $2.4 million. The cash purchase left no public record of whether any money actually changed hands or, if it did, where it came from. I asked Trump at the time for documents relating to the sale; he did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a casino owner, Trump could have lost his license for associating with Weichselbaum. Trump has never been known to use drugs or even drink. What motivated him to risk his valuable license by standing up for a drug trafficker remains unclear to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, in his phone call to me, said he “hardly knew” Weichselbaum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The facts above come from court records,&lt;/b&gt; interviews and other documents in my own files and those generously made available by Barrett, who was the first journalist to take a serious investigative look at Trump.  Our files show Trump connected in various deals to many other mobsters and wise guys.&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-mafia-linked-figure-describes-association-with-trump/2016/05/17/cec6c2c6-16d3-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html?postshare=8261463505936319&amp;amp;tid=ss_tw" target="_blank"&gt;Felix Sater&lt;/a&gt;, a senior Trump advisor and son of a reputed Russian mobster, whom Trump kept on long after he was convicted in a mob-connected stock swindle. And there was Bob Libutti, a racehorse swindler who was quite possibly Trump’s biggest customer at the casino tables at the time. Libutti told me and others about arrangements that went beyond the “comps”—free hotel rooms and services, for example—that casinos can legally give to high-rollers. Among these was a deal to sell Trump a less-than-fit horse at the inflated price of $500,000, though Trump backed out at the last minute. Libutti accused Trump of making an improper $250,000 payment to him, which would have cost Trump his license. The DGE dismissed Libutti as unreliable and took Trump at his word when he denied the allegations. (Libutti was a major figure in my 1992 book &lt;i&gt;Temples of Chance.&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the dealings came at a remove. In Atlantic City, Trump built on property where mobsters controlled parts of the adjoining land needed for parking. He paid $1.1 million for about a 5,000-square-foot lot that had been bought five years earlier for just $195,000. The sellers were Salvy Testa and Frank Narducci Jr., a pair of hitmen for Atlantic City mob boss Nicky Scarfo&lt;b&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;who were&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;known as the Young Executioners. For several adjoining acres, Trump ignored the principal owner of record and instead negotiated directly in a deal that also likely ended up benefiting the Scarfo mob. Trump arranged&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a 98-year lease deal with Sullivan, the FBI informant and labor fixer, and Ken Shapiro, described in government reports as Scarfo’s “investment banker.” Eventually the lease was converted into a sale after the Division of Gaming Enforcement objected to Sullivan and Shapiro being Trump’s landlords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump later boasted in a sworn affidavit in a civil case that he made the deals himself, his “unique contribution” making the land deals possible. In formal hearings Trump later defended Sullivan and Shapiro as “well thought of.” Casino regulators thought otherwise, and banned Sullivan and Shapiro from the casino industry&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; But the Casino Control Commission was never asked to look into FBI reports that Trump was involved, via Shapiro, in the payoffs at the time of the land deals that resulted in Mayor Michael Mathews going to prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks in part to the laxity of New Jersey gaming investigators, Trump has never had to address his dealings with mobsters and swindlers head-on. For instance, Barrett reported in his book that Trump was believed to have met personally with Salerno at Roy Cohn’s townhouse; he found that there were witnesses to the meeting, one of whom kept detailed notes on all of Cohn’s contacts. But instead of looking for the witnesses (one of whom had died) and the office diary one kept, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) took an easier path. They put Trump under oath and asked if he had ever attended such a meeting. Trump denied it. The inquiry ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking Trump at his word that he never met with the mobsters in Cohn’s townhouse saved the casino investigators from having to acknowledge their earlier failure—that from the start, they had never properly investigated Trump and his connections to criminals. They certainly had the leverage to push harder if they chose. Indeed, two of the five Casino Control commissioners in 1991 declared that the DGE showed official favoritism to Trump. Commissioner David Waters complained that DGE did not go nearly far enough in seeking a $30,000 fine against Trump for taking an illegal loan from his father, which could be grounds to revoke Trump’s casino licenses. Waters called it “an outrage that the Division of Gaming Enforcement would take this position and fail to carry out what I understand to be its responsibility to enforce the provisions of the Casino Control Act.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Even after he got his license,&lt;/b&gt; Trump continued to have relationships that should have prompted inquiries. For example, he made a deal to have Cadillacs dolled up with fancy interiors and exteriors beginning in 1988, marketing them as Trump Golden Series and Trump Executive Series limousines. The modifications were made at the Dillinger Coach Works, which was owned by a pair of convicted felons, convicted extortionist Jack Schwartz and convicted thief John Staluppi, who was so close to mobsters that he was invited to the wedding of a mob &lt;i&gt;capo’s &lt;/i&gt;daughter. New York liquor regulators proved tougher than those in New Jersey, denying Staluppi, a rich car dealer, a license because of his rap sheet and his extensive dealings with mobsters, as Barrett’s former reporting partner Bill Bastone &lt;a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/trump-and-staluppi-092157" target="_blank"&gt;found in public records.&lt;/a&gt; So why did Trump repeatedly do business with mob owned businesses and mob-controlled unions? Why go down the aisle with an expensive mobbed-up concrete firm when other options were available?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why’d Donald do it?” Barrett said when I put the question to him. “Because he saw these mob guys as pathways to money, and Donald is all about money.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a $400 million tax giveaway on his first big project, to getting a casino license, to collecting fees for putting his name on everything from bottled water and buildings to neckties and steaks, Trump’s life has been dedicated to the next big score. Through Cohn, Trump made choices that—gratuitously, it appears—resulted in his first known business dealings with mob-controlled companies and unions, a pattern that continued long after Cohn died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Trump has to say about the reasons for his long, close and wide-ranging dealings with organized crime figures, with the role of mobsters in cheating Trump Tower workers, his dealings with Felix Sater and Trump’s seeming leniency for Weichselbaum, are questions that voters deserve full answers about before casting their ballots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <description>Music in the military is a storied tradition, but some lawmakers say $437 million in yearly spending is too much.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Live music in the military has become a nearly half-billion-dollar-a-year road show. But even some of the Pentagon’s top supporters in Congress say it’s time to cut the volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From their humble origins in the American Revolution’s fife-and-drum corps, the U.S. military’s musical ventures have grown to include thousands of service members and at least 137 bands — some of whose members are outfitted with $11,000 flutes and $12,000 tubas. That has placed them in the crosshairs of lawmakers who say it makes no sense to lavish this kind of money on music when the Pentagon is scaling back combat troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entertainment is “just not the role of the military,&amp;quot; said Rep. &lt;a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/227744" target="_blank"&gt;Martha McSally&lt;/a&gt;, a hawkish Arizona Republican and retired Air Force colonel who serves on the Armed Services Committee. She and other lawmakers are ramping up the pressure with new legislation that would require the Pentagon to determine whether it could ease cuts in combat units by reducing the number of musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McSally told POLITICO that military musicians fulfill important ceremonial tasks and protocols — presidential inaugurations, parades and other public events and, of course, funerals. But she can no longer support such large expenditures “when we’re at a place where we’re having this conversation about being at a crisis level of readiness and force structure and manning for our military.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It used to just really irritate me when I would be going to an event, say for a holiday party that a general officer is hosting, and we would have military men and women in uniform entertaining us,” she added. “I used to be uncomfortable with it — that we’ve got these enlisted troops whose job was to entertain generals and their guests at various events.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other lawmakers, though, those are fighting words. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Military bands are vital to recruiting, retention and community relations, and they provide patriotic and inspirational music to instill in soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines the will to fight and win,&amp;quot; said Rep. &lt;a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51316" target="_blank"&gt;John Carter&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas Republican who sits on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musicians are as embedded in U.S. military culture as order and discipline — whether exemplified by the patriotic flourishes of Marine composer John Philip Sousa's &amp;quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&amp;quot; or by “Pershing's Own,&amp;quot; the elite Army band established during World War I to match the pomp and circumstance of America’s European allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Civil War, Union Gen. Philip Sheridan &lt;a href="http://amhistory.si.edu/militaryhistory/collection/object.asp?ID=445" target="_blank"&gt;famously ordered&lt;/a&gt; his musicians to play their instruments loudly and &amp;quot;never mind if a bullet goes through a trombone, or even a trombonist, now and then.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that storied tradition now comes with a hefty price tag. According to Pentagon data from fiscal 2015, the last time the Defense Department did a full inventory, the military spends at least $437 million a year on musicians, their instruments, special uniforms, travel and related costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That marks a steady rise from previous years, even as the Pentagon insists the services have cut a sizable number of musical troupes. By some official estimates, it's now spending $100 million more a year than in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Army, by far, has the largest musical contingent, with a total of 99 bands and approximately 4,350 total musical personnel across its active-duty, National Guard and Reserve forces. The Air Force is second, with 15 bands and 800 personnel, followed by the Marine Corps with 12 bands and 750 personnel and the Navy's 11 bands and 600 musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright asserted that all four military branches have cut the number of bands in recent years, but acknowledges the cuts have done little to rein in the overall cost — largely because the schedule of events at which military musicians perform has not diminished much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With band reductions, operations costs for current bands may increase since remaining bands have to travel more often to cover the workload of eliminated bands,&amp;quot; he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost for band instruments alone has turned some heads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A search on the Federal Business Opportunities website turns up dozens of examples of top-dollar contracts for Army instruments in particular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among them is a $33,000 award for three flutes in April 2015, $12,000 for a tuba this past March, and $88,500 for a concert-grade Steinway piano for the chapel at Fort Riley, Kan. That was purchased in 2013, at the height of across-the-board budget cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exorbitant instrument purchases, according to Wright, are justified because “most band members use the same instrument for years if not their entire career.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, some key lawmakers want a much more rigorous scrub of the whole ensemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The House this week passed legislation that requires the Government Accountability Office to do a wholesale review of the cost and size of military bands — with an eye toward transferring some of those slots to combat units, especially in the Army, which is undergoing reductions in a number of fighting units to align with smaller overall budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;While the committee provides the Department of Defense with a wide latitude of authority for the military services to execute the end-strength reductions that are continuing through fiscal year 2017, the committee is concerned by the prioritization of some military units,&amp;quot; according to the House Armed Services Committee report on the National Defense Authorization Act. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The committee believes,&amp;quot; it added, &amp;quot;that the services may be able to conserve end strength by reducing the number of military bands.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review by GAO is due by February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill also directs Defense Secretary Ash Carter to take a detailed inventory of military bands, study the feasibility of combining some and report back by Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;At a minimum, the briefing shall include: the number of military bands, by service, and their location; the cost of military bands, including recruitment, training, facilities and transportation; the number of service members assigned to military bands; the history of reductions in military bands over the past five years; and the feasibility of combining military bands at joint locations,&amp;quot; according to the armed services panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scrutiny of the expenditures has been building for several years. President Barack Obama's first defense secretary, Robert Gates, pointed out on a number of occasions that the United States has more military musicians than diplomats. And the military branches have canceled some recent musical events, citing budget reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But previous efforts to scale back the overall budget for military bands got heavy push back inside the ranks and on Capitol Hill, including two attempts in the House to cap annual spending at $200 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Rep. &lt;a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51508" target="_blank"&gt;Betty McCollum&lt;/a&gt; (D-Minn.) proposed a $200 million spending limit on military bands, down from nearly $325 million the Pentagon estimated was being spent to support them that year. The amendment was voted down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCollum tried and failed again the following year, when the spending grew to $388 million, proposing a similar amendment to the House defense appropriations bill. She asserted that DoD had spent $1.55 billion on military bands, musical performances and concerts over the previous four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is the United States really going to borrow money from China and other foreign countries so the Defense Department can spend billions of dollars for its 140 bands?” she asked in a floor speech at the time. “How does this enhance our national security?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides tradition, however, supporters view military musicians as a critical link between the men and women in uniform and those they protect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bands and their costs are necessary because music can &amp;quot;facilitate the accomplishment of national objectives at home, overseas and in an expeditionary environment,” said Wright, the Pentagon spokesman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is “not intended to indicate that we swayed an ally to join a war with us in World War II or anything because of it,” he added. Rather, it speaks to using music as a unifier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We don't want to become separated and mysterious to the U.S. public,” he said. “We want them to understand us and see us for what we are; we are them, as well as defenders of our common nation.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rep. Carter, who argued against capping spending on military bands, added: &amp;quot;As we are still engaged in a war and peacekeeping missions around the world, military bands cover the departure and homecomings for many units, and when needed will cover funerals of our fallen warriors, a tradition that means so much to our military families.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Congress grapples with how to finance many military priorities that are strapped for resources, those like McSally believe it's time for the Pentagon to face the music. The military just has too many bands and too many performances, especially if they come at the expense of more important tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One could make an argument that these various military bands are nice to do and important to do,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;But then there’s the core competencies of our military, of the things that we have to do, what we must do, and what we’re responsible for. And it just not seem logical to me that they are making the case that they have this manning crisis while we’re still having personnel in these positions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Michelle Fields joins The Huffington Post, will cover Trump</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/05/michelle-fields-joins-the-huffington-post-223457</link>
      <description>Fields left Breitbart earlier this year amid controversy.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Huffington Post has hired former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields, the site announced on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fields will be on the political team covering presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, an interesting position for Fields considering her history with the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Fields, who was then working for Breitbart, accused Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski of forcefully grabbing her out of the way after she tried to ask Trump a question during an event in Florida. When the campaign initially denied the event took place and called Fields &amp;quot;delusional&amp;quot;, Fields filed a police report which led to battery charges against Lewandowski, though a Florida prosecutor &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/trump-campaign-manager-lewandowski-221921" target="_blank"&gt;decided in April not to prosecute&lt;/a&gt;. Fields, and at least six other staffers, left Breitbart shortly after the incident, saying the website failed to adequately support her at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Breitbart, Fields was the Ted Cruz campaign reporter, and was at the Trump event in March to cover for a colleague who was sick. At The Huffington Post though, she'll be on the Trump trail full time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the site does not shy away from taking a stand on Trump (each story mentioning the candidate comes with a tag that he is a &amp;quot;liar,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;xenophobe,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;birther&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;racist&amp;quot;), assigning a reporter with such a direct personal history with a candidate is an unusual move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I'd say that we all have our biases, whether we admit it or not, but as always the work should stand for itself,&amp;quot; Huffington Post's Washington bureau chief Ryan Grim said in an email, adding that he's &amp;quot;very excited&amp;quot; for Fields to get started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;After the tumultuous events of the last few months, I am ready to get back to writing and reporting on what is without question the most bizarrely fascinating presidential race of my lifetime (and, perhaps, any lifetime),&amp;quot; Fields said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/22/media/michelle-fields-huffington-post-donald-trump/index.html?iid=Lead" target="_blank"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Clinton, Trump in tightening race in new poll</title>

      <description/>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton edges past presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by just three points in a new national &lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/clintons-lead-over-trump-shrinks-3-points-new-nbc-news-n577726" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll&lt;/a&gt; released Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton leads Trump 46 percent to 43 percent, within the poll’s 3.1 percentage-point margin of error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding indicates a tightening race between two candidates with high unfavorable ratings. Clinton led Trump by 50 percent to 39 percent in an April NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new poll of 1,000 registered voters May 15-19 found that 58 percent of voters view Trump unfavorably, while 54 percent have an unfavorable impression of Clinton. Forty-seven percent of the voters surveyed said they would consider a third-party candidate in a general election match between Clinton and Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a match-up between Trump and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is trailing Clinton  the Democratic presidential nomination. the poll found Sanders leading Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Trump slips by Clinton in a virtual dead heat in new poll</title>

      <description/>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump holds a razor-thin lead over Hillary Clinton in a&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-election-2016-shapes-up-as-a-contest-of-negatives/2016/05/21/8d4ccfd6-1ed3-11e6-b6e0-c53b7ef63b45_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-banner-main_poll0522-1201am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory" target="_blank"&gt; Washington Post-ABC News poll&lt;/a&gt; released Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presumptive Republican presidential nominee leads by just 2 points, 46 percent to 44 percent, over the Democratic front-runner among registered voters — essentially a dead heat, well within the poll’s 3.5 percentage-point margin of error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll indicates a race in which Clinton once held a commanding lead is shaping up to be extremely close. Clinton led Trump 50 percent to 41 percent in a March Post/ABC poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new poll also tested a race in which 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney jumps in. In that matchup, Clinton captured 37 percent of those surveyed, with Trump 35 percent and Romney at 22 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Trump and Clinton are hampered by staggering unfavorable ratings — viewed unfavorably by 57 percent of those surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll of 829 registered voters was conducted May 16-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Sanders: Voters see Clinton as 'the lesser of two evils'</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/sanders-clinton-two-evils-223449</link>
      <description/>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;American voters should not be forced to pick between “the lesser of two evils” this November, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked in an interview airing Sunday on ABC's &amp;quot;This Week&amp;quot; if that's how he'd describe a possible match-up between Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Sanders said it was not him making the characterization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s what the American people are saying,” he said. “If you look at the favorability ratings of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, both of them have very, very high unfavorables.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent CNN/ORC polls showed 57 percent of voters nationally viewed Trump unfavorably, while 49 percent viewed Clinton that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders continued to emphasize that he'll stay in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, though he acknowledged the delegate math provides for “a very steep uphill climb.” He also appealed to so-called super delegates, who are not bound to any candidate at the Democratic National Convention, to consider switching their support from Clinton to him over issues of electability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at virtually all of the polls done in the last six, seven weeks, in every one of them, nationally polls and statewide polls, we defeat Trump by larger margins — in some cases, significantly larger margins — than does Secretary Clinton,” Sanders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders also pushed back against media reports about violence from his supporters at the recent state Democratic convention in Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People were rude, that's not good. They were booing, that's not good. They behaved in some ways that were a little bit boorish, not good. But let's not talk about that as violence,” Sanders said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;If those same supporters want to protest at the national convention in Philadelphia, Sanders said that's their right, though he's not “encouraging anybody” to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the way his candidacy has emboldened the Democratic Party’s left flank, Sanders ticked off the stands he sees as necessary for Clinton to take if she's the nominee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have every confidence that if Hillary Clinton is prepared to stand up to the greed of corporate America and Wall Street; is prepared to be really strong on the issue of climate change; support, as I do, a tax on carbon; is prepared to say that the United States of America should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people, paid family and medical leave; is prepared to say that the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality today in America, where almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. If she is strong on those issues, yeah, I think she will win and win by a large vote,” Sanders said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But if she is not, she's going to have her problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Mark Cuban: I'd consider a future White House bid</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/mark-cuban-open-to-future-white-house-bid-223445</link>
      <description/>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks who rebuffed pleas from conservatives to run for president, says he's open to running in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, it's certainly more of a consideration than it was,&amp;quot; Cuban said in an interview airing Sunday on NBC's &amp;quot;Meet the Press.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You don't have to be the perfect Stepford candidate like you would've been in the past.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushed by host Chuck Todd on what could bring him to run in 2020 or 2024, Cuban demurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's too early to tell,&amp;quot; said Cuban, who is also a host on the TV show &amp;quot;Shark Tank.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I mean, depending on what happened with, you know, whoever's elected, depending on what happens with the economy because the reality is, there's so much uncertainty with the economy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There're so many variables that I don't have the answers to,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A self-professed independent, Cuban said he'd consider offers to serve as vice president from both presumed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton, though, would have to &amp;quot;go more to center,&amp;quot; Cuban said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And I'd have the same conversation for Donald,&amp;quot; Cuban said. &amp;quot;I think Donald has a real chance to win, and that's scary to a lot of people. But what's scary about it to me is that you can see him now trying to do what he thinks is right to unify the party. And he's listening to everybody, which is fine on the surface. But what's also happening is it's coming across as if he's proposing things based off the last person he talks to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's grasp of policy and temperament are worrying, Cuban said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You know, it's possible for anybody to change,&amp;quot; he said when asked about Trump's temperament. &amp;quot;But, you know, I just don't see evidence that he wants to change. I think he's trying to do what he thinks is the right thing right now. But there's just so much coming at him at once, he's looking for shortcuts. And this is just not a job where there're shortcuts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuban also gave a preview of what his own candidacy might look like. He pronounced his support for free-trade agreements, higher taxes on Wall Street and efforts to drive down college tuition, which he said has increased because of &amp;quot;easy money.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuban also said he supports President Barack Obama's signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;From an entrepreneur's perspective, it's given entrepreneurs the chance to leave jobs they were stuck in and get insurance where they otherwise might not have had it,&amp;quot; Cuban said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Homeland security chief hits Trump's Muslim ban</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/homeland-security-chief-hits-trumps-muslim-ban-223450</link>
      <description/>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Sunday hit presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A ban, immigration policy based on religion, is unwise and counter-productive, frankly,” Johnson said on &amp;quot;Fox News Sunday.&amp;quot; “We need to build bridges to Muslim communities. We need to build bridges to American Muslim communities.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson also spoke about Thursday’s EgyptAir crash, a disaster that some, including Trump and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, have said was likely caused by terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, we do not rule out an act of terrorism, but it’s still early,” Johnson said. As to the candidates’ declaration that the crash was likely a terrorist act, he said he had “no comment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the increasingly long lines at TSA checkpoints at U.S. airports, Johnson said, “We’re not going to short-cut aviation security,” noting the average security wait time at major airports remains about half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re working aggressively to build up the TSA workforce,” he said. “We’re working with Congress now for more funding. Congress has approved more funding.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the TSA plans to have about 800 new officers on board by June, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson also sought to calm concerns about the safety of flights coming to the U.S. from overseas airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every flight bound to the U.S., he said “has to be screened to U.S. standards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Obama's Asian nuclear nightmare</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/obama-nuke-223412</link>
      <description>Fueled by Trump's rhetoric and North Korea's threats, Japan and South Korea are eyeing nuclear weapons of their own.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama's trip to Asia next week will be anchored by a stop in Hiroshima, where he will focus on its dark nuclear past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Obama’s visit comes at a moment when U.S. and Asian officials fear the region is entering a newly dangerous atomic future, threatening Obama’s vow to roll back the spread of nuclear arms and possibly touching off an Asian nuclear arms race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Korea is expanding its nuclear arsenal and upgrading its ballistic missiles. China is growing and modernizing its stockpile. Most strikingly, Pentagon planners worry that Japan and South Korea might for the first time explore developing nuclear arms of their own — promoted in part by the recent conclusion by U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies that North Korea’s bizarre regime can now mount a small nuclear warhead on missiles capable of striking Japan and South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there is Donald Trump, who recently questioned one of Asia’s core security assumptions: a nuclear-weapons free Japan. “Wouldn’t you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?” Trump asked in a March New York Times interview. Seared by the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan has forsworn nuclear weapons since World War II, though it runs a nuclear energy program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama’s visit Friday to Hiroshima, which was incinerated by a U.S. atomic bomb in August 1945, will promote a message diametrically opposite from Trump’s. “It’s an opportunity to focus the world’s attention on the need to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and seek a world without them,” said deputy national adviser Ben Rhodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s part of Obama’s broader and long-stated goal of limiting nuclear proliferation — one he has pursued with mixed results. Obama sealed a nuclear deal with Iran that stopped its path to a bomb, for now, and has led efforts to secure loose nuclear material worldwide. But he has not achieved major reductions in the U.S. nuclear arsenal, thanks in part to Russia’s resistance to making comparable cuts. Nor has he slowed dangerous atomic expansions in North Korea and Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after the Iran deal averted what Obama predicted would be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, Asia suddenly looms large as an atomic danger zone. Seemingly immune to sanctions and isolation, North Korea presses on with its weapons program: Recent satellite imagery suggests that North Korea may be building a new tunnel in preparation for its fifth nuclear test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are losing patience with international efforts to thwart Pyongyang’s program. Some suspect China is all too happy with a status quo that keeps North Korea contained and stable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those governments increasingly fret that the U.S., which has protected them for decades under a nuclear umbrella, may become a less reliable ally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is particularly fraught in Japan, which has a post-World War II policy of pacifism enshrined in its constitution. But last year Japan passed legislation reinterpreting its constitution to allow foreign military operations for the first time since World War II, though only ones that are defensive in nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some officials and analysts say the anti-nuclear taboo is also being revisited, especially as China asserts new territorial claims, including over islands and waters claimed by Japan. At the same time, many Japanese leaders feel that Obama has not challenged Beijing forcefully enough. Trump’s suggestion that Japan and South Korea might need to fend for themselves has only exacerbated the concerns that America can no longer be relied on for protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Careless American rhetoric that calls into question America’s security commitment in general and extended nuclear deterrent in particular fuels Tokyo’s security planners to develop hedging strategies,” said Patrick Cronin, senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has often been thought that Japan has a bomb in the basement, and it would just have to assemble the parts to create a bomb,” Cronin added. “The technical challenges might actually be much greater than that, but it is the political hurdles that remain the real barriers to Japan acquiring nuclear weapons.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those barriers, while still high, may be eroding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Trump’s comments in March, for instance, the governor of Japan’s Osaka prefecture told reporters that the country should revisit the question of nuclear weapons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What do we do if America’s military strength [in Japan] disappears?” asked the governor, Ichiro Matsui. “Wishful thinking doesn’t get us anywhere.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Japanese conservatives have made the same argument in recent years, including Shintaro Ishihara, who served as Tokyo’s governor until 2012 and said in 2011 that Japan “should absolutely possess nuclear weapons.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such talk has been striking to Japan experts in the U.S., who have assumed for decades that the country would remain non-nuclear. “Very few except the extreme fringes used to talk about nuclear weapons” in Japan, said Richard Samuels, director of MIT’s Center for International Studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pro-nuclear weapons sentiment in Japan remains mostly on the far right, to be sure. But the same conversation is brewing in South Korea, where a 2013 poll found that two-thirds of South Koreans support developing nukes in response to its bellicose northern neighbor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seoul can no longer sit idly by as the [nuclear] talks lead to no results and Washington and Beijing are busy blaming each other for their diplomatic failures,” argued an editorial in Seoul’s conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such talk “is driven by a deep fear of abandonment” by the U.S., Cronin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama himself was dismissive when asked at an April 1 news conference about Trump’s talk of allowing Japan and South Korea to build their own nuclear weapons, saying they reveal that “Trump doesn’t know much about foreign policy, or nuclear policy, or the Korean Peninsula, or the world generally.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. alliance with Japan and South Korea, he added, “is one of the foundations, one of the cornerstones of our presence in the Asia-Pacific region,” he said, adding that it “has prevented the possibilities of a nuclear escalation” in the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So you don’t mess with that,” Obama said. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>5 numbers that mattered this week</title>

      <description>POLITICO&amp;#39;s deep dive into the biggest numbers, stats and percentages in politics this week.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continuing our POLITICO feature, where we dig into the latest polls and loop in other data streams to tell the story of the 2016 campaign. Here are five numbers that mattered this week.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="-webkit-user-select: none" src="http://static2.politico.com/dims4/default/e8436b1/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F47%2F8e%2Ff09685e24382b237fc90bf09c728%2F91-percentpng.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign’s&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;raison d'&amp;ecirc;tre is his continued over-performance relative to Hillary Clinton in general-election matchups with Donald Trump, the apparent GOP nominee, despite the near-certainty Sanders will finish behind Clinton in pledged delegates at the end of the Democratic nominating process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week brought a raft of new polls that add to Sanders’ argument — and underscore that Clinton won’t necessarily inherit those Sanders voters once she is the nominee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2016/05/18/fox-news-poll-2016-national-release-may-18/" target="_blank"&gt;Fox News poll&lt;/a&gt; showed Clinton trailing Trump by 3 points, and Sanders leading Trump by 4 points. &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/313215594/CBS-NYT-Poll-Toplines-May" target="_blank"&gt;CBS News/New York Times&lt;/a&gt; had Clinton leading Trump by 6 points, but Sanders ahead by 13 points. An online poll from &lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/hillary-clinton-holds-slim-national-lead-over-donald-trump-poll-n574901" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News/SurveyMonkey&lt;/a&gt; showed an even wider chasm: Clinton was just 3 points ahead of Trump, far smaller than Sanders’ 12-point lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SurveyMonkey went a step further, helping to identify the voters who would support Sanders over Trump but would choose Trump over Clinton. And it does not bode well for Clinton’s hopes to bring these rogue Sanders backers into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whopping 91 percent of these Sanders-Trump voters have an unfavorable impression of Clinton, according to SurveyMonkey, including 73 percent who have a strongly unfavorable opinion. They aren’t big Trump fans, either, but Trump’s negatives among these voters  — 63 percent unfavorable, 31 percent strongly unfavorable — are less acute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="-webkit-user-select: none" src="http://static2.politico.com/dims4/default/8476243/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F45%2Fb0%2Fbecafaed4adf9b30611ac2f75e6a%2F43-percent.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has united most Republican voters behind his candidacy — but that doesn’t mean those voters feel any better about the future of the GOP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a narrow majority of Republican voters, 55 percent, in the CBS News/New York Times poll this week said they feel “mostly hopeful” about the party’s future, compared to 43 percent who feel “mostly discouraged.” That’s basically unchanged from two years ago, when 55 percent of GOP voters were hopeful, and 41 percent were discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats, on the other hand, are far more hopeful about their party. Even as Democratic fissures appear to widen as the nominating process reaches its culmination, fully 80 percent of Democratic voters are “mostly hopeful” about the future of the party, while only 17 percent are “mostly discouraged.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a marked improvement from two years ago, when 69 percent were hopeful, and 27 percent were discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="-webkit-user-select: none" src="http://static2.politico.com/dims4/default/f316dd7/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F65%2Fe4%2F332d18a948c9a447599eabb4626e%2F1924.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unofficial returns from Kentucky’s Democratic presidential primary this week show Clinton with a lead over Sanders of fewer than 2,000 votes — making Kentucky the second-closest primary state thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton’s advantage over Sanders in Kentucky amounted to about 0.42 percentage points as of late Friday. That’s close enough that The Associated Press and some other news organizations have not yet called the contest. (CNN projected Clinton as the winner, while NBC News is classifying Clinton as the “apparent winner.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the margin holds when the vote is certified, it would be the second-closest Democratic primary this year. Clinton defeated Sanders by only 0.25 percentage points in Missouri — a race The Associated Press called for Clinton the next evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton’s final margin of victory in Iowa was also about 0.25 percentage points — but those are represented in state-delegate equivalents, not votes. Moreover, exit-poll data indicate Clinton led Sanders in initial vote preference by a few points, but Sanders closed the gap in the final tally after supporters of former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley joined his supporters when O’Malley was deemed not viable in most caucus sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="-webkit-user-select: none" src="http://static2.politico.com/dims4/default/19b11da/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa1%2Fcb%2F08aa8d1f49e3b1db7afa73f98fab%2F56-percent.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the general election, it’s almost certain Trump will lose badly in swing-state cities — like Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Denver, Milwaukee, Las Vegas and Charlotte. But there’s reason to believe he may been even weaker than other Republican candidates in those cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of Oregon’s 36 counties, Trump ran weakest in Multnomah County, home to Portland, on Tuesday night. He won 56 percent of the vote there, worse than his 64-percent performance statewide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a similar story in other larger cities in recent primaries: Trump won 43 percent of the vote in Baltimore City on April 26, below the 54 percent he won statewide in Maryland. New York County, or Manhattan, was the only county Trump lost on April 19 in New York State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One bright spot for Trump: He matched his 57-percent statewide share of the vote on April 26 in Philadelphia — the eastern anchor of Pennsylvania, where Trump is expected to compete for the commonwealth’s 20 electoral votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="-webkit-user-select: none" src="http://static2.politico.com/dims4/default/8795bd4/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F6e%2F49%2F4ce6082144a9ab7feab84afa0d5b%2F98657-percent.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Californians have until next Monday to register for the June 5 primary, but there are indications that the Democratic candidates are already bringing new voters on to the rolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 100,000 registered Democrats were added over roughly the first three months of 2016, according to data released last month by the California secretary of state’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uptick in registration is confined to Democrats: Republicans shed 14,966 voters over the same time period, and there are 23,975 fewer voters who expressed no party preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats, however, are allowing decline-to-state voters to participate in their presidential primary next month. Republicans are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New data will be released before the primary, but through April 8, Democrats represented 43.7 percent of the electorate — and combined with the 23.9 percent of decline-to-state voters, more than two-thirds of registered voters were eligible to vote in the Democratic primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans accounted for 27.5 percent of the electorate — down significantly from April 2012, when they made up 30.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Trump, Clinton gird for epic battle over guns</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/guns-trump-clinton-second-amendment-nra-223448</link>
      <description>The 2 likely general election candidates are already tearing into each other over the Second Amendment.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Guns are going to be on the ballot like never before this November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Newtown and a wave of fatal clashes with police seared into the nation’s memory, Democrats and Republicans alike are eager to wage the fight over guns during the general election, and both sides forcefully flashed their rhetorical ammunition in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump was warmly — if a bit warily — received Friday as 80,000 members of the National Rifle Association gathered here to launch a united front against Hillary Clinton, whom they see as a bigger threat to the Second Amendment than Trump would ever be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan billionaire echoed the group’s charge that Clinton would “take your guns away from you,” both through her own actions and with her Supreme Court picks, all while failing to keep Americans safe from terrorists abroad and violent criminals at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton leapt at the chance to rile up Democrats. She responded Saturday with her own broadside against the gun lobby and Trump, saying his candidacy would put “more kids at risk of violence and bigotry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither candidate can move to the center on guns as they pivot to the general election: Clinton because it marked one of the few issues where she could run to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ left, and Trump because the gun rights movement is leading the charge for GOP unity around his candidacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides are mobilizing with relish, with the NRA and Clinton finding each other convenient foils as they try to rally their bases following bruising primaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hillary, you picked this fight, but mark my words, we will win it,” said top NRA strategist Chris Cox on Saturday. On Friday, Cox opened the group’s annual meeting by announcing a formal endorsement of Trump, who has embraced the group’s cause of protecting and expanding gun rights. But the main emphasis of the first two days of the conference was on caustic and often personal attacks against Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, her full-throated advocacy for gun control is unprecedented for a Democratic presidential candidate (and for her, for that matter), and Democrats down ballot are increasingly following her lead. While she has not called for abolishing the Second Amendment, as Trump has charged, she’s pushed hard for “common sense gun laws,” including expanded background checks. She has made exposing the gun industry to liability a central plank of her Democratic primary campaign against Sanders, whose home state of Vermont highly values its gun rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a clear shift in tone and emphasis from 2008, when she described herself as a pro-gun churchgoer after Barack Obama was caught on tape ahead of the Pennsylvania primary criticizing working-class people who “cling to their guns and religion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Clinton used the issue to make her case against Trump in the battleground state of Florida, and cast the NRA’s target on her back as a badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unlike Donald Trump, I will not pander to the gun lobby, and we will not be silenced and we will not be intimidated,” Clinton said Saturday evening at a Trayvon Martin Foundation event in Fort Lauderdale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although NRA members have a reputation for voting on the Second Amendment, and President Barack Obama has urged people who want new gun restrictions to become “single issue voters,” both sides are weaving guns into a broader negative narrative about how their opponent is creating a more dangerous — and unequal — world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No guns on the other side” was Trump’s refrain on Friday, describing defenseless victims of terror attacks and mass shootings. He debuted a new nickname for Clinton — “Heartless Hillary” — as he accused her of wanting to take guns from women, even as her own security detail (a United States Secret Service force similar to the one that protects him) is armed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In trying to overturn the Second Amendment, Hillary Clinton is telling everyone — and every woman living in a dangerous community — that she doesn’t have the right to defend herself,” Trump said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NRA members waiting for Trump to take the stage watched videos warning about the threat from “radical Islamic terrorism” and calling out “self-serving politicians … who would condemn America’s police” as images of Clinton flashed across the screen. That same stage featured Mark “Oz” Geist, a security contractor at the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, who has become a chief critic of Clinton’s handling of the deadly attack in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were faced with an evil that night that wanted to take away our way of life,” said Geist. “I think with this election, it’s not that different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre wove in other social issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rising ISIS attacks, terrorism in Europe, innocent children being slain in our cities by murderers the White House refuses to take off the streets before they kill, ever-growing serious threats to our nation, and the president’s biggest concern is school bathrooms?” LaPierre said Friday. “That is what a Clinton White House looks like, and more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no attempt to clean up Trump’s record on guns, including now-abandoned positions staked out in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” in which he backed an assault weapons ban and supported longer waiting periods to buy guns. For the group’s leadership, Trump’s record doesn’t matter much when Clinton’s is so clear, and to them so clearly bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton, meanwhile, used Trump’s newfound embrace of the NRA and his call to end gun-free zones to cast him as a reckless bully and a hypocrite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents, teachers and schools should have a right to keep guns out of classrooms — just like Donald Trump does at many of his hotels, by the way,” Clinton said Saturday. “This is somebody running for president of the United States of America, a country facing a gun violence epidemic, and he is talking about more guns in our schools, he is talking about more hatred and division in our streets, even more nuclear weapons in the world. That’s no way to keep us safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the hours leading up to Clinton’s speech, her campaign sent out fundraising pitches from former Rep. Gabby Giffords and Erica Smegielski, the daughter of the principal killed at Sandy Hook Elementary, asking supporters to stand with Clinton against Trump and the NRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For almost two decades, many Democrats, including Bill Clinton, blamed the assault weapons ban for their devastating losses in the 1994 midterms. That all changed when a gunman slaughtered 20 first-graders in Newtown, Connecticut, in late 2012, Democrats and gun control advocates say. While they failed to pass expanded background checks in its wake — a victory for the NRA and its impassioned membership in the face of overwhelming approval for the measure in polls — Democrats hope the issue will help them up and down the ballot in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are pushing hard towards the tipping point,” Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.), who represents Newtown, said Friday in a call with reporters and activists organized by the Democratic National Committee. “This is the first presidential election” she added, in which gun safety legislation “has been a top-tier issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors could help Democrats make guns a winning issue for them in November, including money and research from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety and organization from Giffords’ Americans for Responsible Solutions, which is endorsing candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But so far, the NRA appears to be more aggressive in using another tool for maintaining intensity: the fight over the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before endorsing Trump, Cox played two clips of Clinton remarks in the arena. One, from February, showed her barking like a dog. The other was a recording from a private fundraiser in October saying, “The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cox warned, “She’ll put a radical, anti-gun activist in Scalia’s seat as soon as she can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump echoed the point and called on Clinton to follow his lead by releasing a list of her potential Supreme Court nominees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as Trump and Clinton called each other dangerous hypocrites based on their gun policies, they do present a stark choice for American voters on the substance of gun policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Folks are getting tired of personality contrasts,” Esty said. “And we are going to have core contrast on this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>NRA facing member backlash over Trump endorsement</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/nra-donald-trump-endorsement-backlash-223442</link>
      <description>The early endorsement was a push for GOP unity. But not all NRA members are eager to fall in line.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;LOUISVILLE, Ky. — With its last-minute decision to formally endorse Donald Trump, the National Rifle Association put itself out in front of the fight for Republican party unity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a day later, it’s already taking flak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cox, the NRA’s top strategist, was met with raucous applause when he announced to the estimated 80,000 people gathered here for the group’s annual leadership forum on Friday that the nation’s biggest and most influential gun-rights organization was officially backing the presumptive Republican nominee. To endorse so early in the process is virtually unprecedented for the group; they didn’t get behind Mitt Romney in 2012 and Sen. John McCain in 2008 until October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your preferred candidate dropped out of the race, it’s time to get over it,” Cox said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone is there yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have no clue why they did it,” said Brian Abney of Missouri. He was among the much smaller contingent that showed up to the NRA’s Annual Members Meeting on Saturday, hoping to grill the NRA’s brass about the decision to endorse a man who not long ago backed longer waiting periods to buy guns and a ban on assault weapons (which, NRA activists will tell you, is an inaccurate, anti-gun term for that category of firearms). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has since disavowed those views, and on Friday, he called for an end to gun-free zones while warning that Clinton would overturn the Second Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will not let you down,” Trump vowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abney is in complete agreement that Hillary Clinton is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t trust her,” Abney said, who traveled from St. Louis to attend his sixth NRA conference. “It seems like scandal follows her around.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of Trump, he added, “I think of him about the same way I think of Hillary,” noting the billionaire’s many position changes over the years. Abney said he hopes Trump can somehow win his trust, but he’s also considering a third party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NRA’s early endorsement of Trump makes any third-party bid on the right more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a very clear choice,” said an NRA official on Saturday, who insisted on speaking anonymously about internal NRA deliberations. “Hillary Clinton is not an option. She must be defeated at all costs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign was “heated,” the official said, so the NRA saw the early endorsement as “an opportunity to begin the process of bringing everyone together to defeat Hillary Clinton and elect a pro-Second Amendment president.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s more recent statements put him on strong footing, the official said. “Throughout this campaign, Donald Trump has been very clear that he is a staunch supporter of Second Amendment rights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been unclear, initially, whether the NRA would simply trash Clinton while giving Trump a platform on Friday, or formally back him. Rep. Allan West, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and Tea Party darling, was ambivalent about the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s the alternative?” West said Saturday in a brief interview. As a freshly elected member of NRA’s board, he wasn’t involved with the endorsement decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got to endorse someone that you think will look after your interests,” West said. “I guess they figured that Donald Trump will protect the Second Amendment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he trusts Trump to protect the Second Amendment, West responded, “We’ll have to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backlash, which also played out in a pitched debate among the rank-and-file on NRA’s Facebook page, is a sign that GOP unity cannot be rushed, even by groups with the credibility of the NRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can endorse anyone you want including the lying, progressive, anti-gun democrat DJ Trump, but you don't get to tell your dues paying membership ‘get over it,’” posted David Davis, who said he was ending his 30-year membership. “I didn't leave the NRA, the NRA left me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s still plenty of support, both enthusiastic and resigned, for Trump among the attendees here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s a change of heart. I think he’s become educated,” said John Coffindaffer. He and his wife considered Ted Cruz before ultimately backing Trump in the Alabama primary. And as former Connecticut residents who faced harassment from their neighbors after testifying against new gun measures proposed by state legislators in response to the Newtown shootings, they are committed Second Amendment defenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Trump’s son is a big time hunter and I believe without a doubt that our second amendment rights are way safer with Trump than Hillary Clinton!” wrote Josh Moriarty on Facebook. “I have a hard time believing that no one has different views as they grow as a person or change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without the endorsement, the NRA’s anybody-but-Clinton message was seared into every speech and video. Indeed, attacks on her approach to Benghazi, her honesty and, of course, her threat to the Second Amendment dominated the entire five-hour program on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Were there differences between the candidates for the nomination? Of course,” Cox said Friday. “Will any of it matter if Hillary wins in November?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The audience answered him, with a resounding “NO!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Clinton previews her general-election attacks</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/hillary-clinton-previews-general-election-attacks-223447</link>
      <description/>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previewing her general election line of attack, Hillary Clinton is lambasting Donald Trump as dangerous and unqualified to be president. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My campaign is not going to let Donald Trump try to normalize himself,” the Democratic presidential front-runner said in an interview aired Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “I’ve said he was unqualified to be president. I believe that deeply.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former New York senator and secretary of state hit the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for refusing to release his tax returns, talking of pulling the U.S. out of NATO and, she said, of “advocating a return to torture, and even murdering the families of suspected terrorists.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is beyond the pale. And it poses immediate dangers,” Clinton said. “There’s no evidence he has any ideas about making America great, as he advertises. He seems to be particularly focused on making himself appear great. And as we go through this campaign, we’re going to be demonstrating the hollowness of his rhetoric. And the danger of a lot of what he has said.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has said he’d support re-implementing waterboarding and “worse” in interrogating suspected terrorists and that the U.S. should “go after” the families of terrorists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton is still in the midst of a Democratic primary battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But, in recent days, she’s touted her lead in pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention and declared unequivocally that she would be the nominee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sen. Sanders has every right to finish off his campaign however he chooses,” Clinton said. “There will then be the obvious need for us to unify the party. I faced the same challenge in 2008. I will certainly do my part, reaching out to Sen. Sanders, reaching out to his supporters. And I expect him to do his.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeatedly referring to her 2008 primary loss to then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, Clinton said, “I know what this feels like, having lived through it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to talk with [Sanders] when he’s ready to talk, and listen to him,” Clinton said. “And we will take into account what he is asking for.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Clinton vowed to conduct a thorough search for a vice presidential running mate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should look widely and broadly,” she said. “It’s not just people in elective office. It is successful business people. I am very interested in that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she appreciated Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban’s “openness” to considering serving as her running mate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am absolutely intending to look far and wide,” she said. “And I think that is the best way to find somebody who can really capture what’s needed in the country, and business people have, especially successful business people who are really successful as opposed to pretend successful.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Inside the Clinton paid speech machine</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/inside-the-clinton-paid-speech-machine-223395</link>
      <description>What, exactly, do you get when you pay a Clinton $285,000 for an intimate, closed-to-the-press speech?</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hillary and Bill Clinton’s highly paid speeches — whose transcripts they steadfastly refuse to release despite pressure on the campaign trail — are cloaked in secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have both seized on the issue, raising red flags about what the Clintons say behind closed doors to Wall Street firms and other groups that they don’t say in public. By digging in their heels, the Clintons have only drawn more attention to the question: What, exactly, do you get when you pay a Clinton hundreds of thousands of dollars for an intimate, closed-to-the-press speech?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Bill Clinton’s case, it turns out, you get a dose of the full, unplugged Bubba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A transcript of a private, $285,000 paid speech Bill Clinton delivered last year at the “China-U.S. Private Investment Summit” in Austin, Texas, obtained by POLITICO, offers a glimpse behind the curtain of the Clintons' controversial paid speaking gigs — and some insight into how the former president holds court out of sight of the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once I got a cartoon in the mail when I was fighting out that Whitewater business,” he reminisced in front of about 60 Chinese investors and 150 American business people gathered to discuss bilateral investment opportunities in late March 2015 — two weeks before Hillary Clinton officially declared her candidacy. “And Jiang Zemin and I are sitting together at a state dinner, and in the first frame, I say to President Jiang, I said, ‘You know, you're doing great economically, but our country has more human rights.’ And he looked at me and he said, ‘Yes, and if you were the leader of China, Ken Starr would be in prison making running shoes.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A self-deprecating Clinton admitted of those scandal-tarred days of his presidency: “I saved that cartoon for a long time. I must say there were days when I wondered who had the better model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Clinton has raked in close to $3 million in paid speeches since his wife launched her second bid for the White House last April, according to Hillary Clinton's most recent financial disclosure. The enormous fee for the Texas speech — which took place when Hillary Clinton was already scouting campaign office space but had yet to officially announced her bid — signals just how much well-heeled clients are willing to pay to hear from a former, and potentially future, occupant of the White House. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxing philosophical at one point, the former president mused:&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“I learned that the weight, combined weight, of all the ants on Earth is greater than the combined weight of all the people on Earth. That’s sobering,” Clinton said, quoting a fact from microbiologist E.O. Wilson’s book “The Social Conquest of Earth,&amp;quot; which he called “the most important political book I have read in the last five years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;His long digression on insect life was to furnish a broader point about cooperation between nations. At one point, discussing world leaders he has respected, he said emotionally: “I never loved another man more than I loved Yitzhak Rabin. I can't even describe how I felt about him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton’s expansive, discursive speaking style is sometimes on display on the campaign trail, where it is criticized as a distraction from his goal of touting his wife’s accomplishments. But the transcript of a private speech shows off a freer, looser Clinton than the one who has been trying to sell&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a candidate who is seen as the definition of status quo as &amp;quot;the best change maker I've ever known.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Austin speech also suggests that Bill Clinton's talents might best be used in a diplomatic capacity, rather than in a role designed to oversee economic domestic policy, as the Democratic front-runner recently suggested — which sparked criticism that she was leaning too much on her husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the private speech in front of the conservative-leaning business group, Bill Clinton assumed a diplomatic tone discussing China, displaying a softer edge than his wife shows on the campaign trail, where she typically highlights security issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He touted the importance of investment opportunities in China, noting “we all know what the problems are, but I want to talk to you about the opportunities and why I think it’s so important that you’re here.” Extending an open hand, he added: “It doesn’t bother me that we have differences of opinion. And we should not seek to abolish them or sweep them under the rug. We should instead become comfortable talking about them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president did, however, acknowledge the detention last year of five Chinese women who tried to start a campaign against sexual harassment — which Hillary Clinton denounced on Twitter as an &amp;quot;inexcusable&amp;quot; act that &amp;quot;must end.&amp;quot; But he did so in less severe terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think that it's too bad these women have been arrested in the run up to the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Conference,” he said. “I think that there's a way to be a strong country and tolerate dissent.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton has a hawkish reputation when it comes to China — as secretary of state, she railed against Beijing’s “deplorable” human rights record and even questioned the future of the Chinese regime. But her campaign aides have also suggested China needs to be a partner to the United States in creating stability in Afghanistan. In his speech, Bill Clinton stuck to an upbeat pitch to investors as well as hope for a prosperous future between the superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There may come a time when the U.S. and China will become involved in some irreconcilable conflict, as many pessimists believe, but it doesn't have to happen if we work for the best and both plan for our security,” he said. “I think you can make a lot of money if you're Chinese investing in America and I think you can make a lot of money if you're American investing in China. ... I think the Chinese president is doing things that make sense. It's a good time to invest there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasized that both sides need each other: “It is very, very important to do what you are here to do. We need more Chinese investment in America, just like we need more American investment in China. ... Nobody is right all the time. Differences of opinion are healthy and debate is important, but it is really important to find a way for what we have in common to trump our interesting differences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, hiring Bill Clinton as a keynote speaker doesn't mean he will limit himself to the specific topic of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Q&amp;amp;A following the speech, Clinton discussed at length&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the influence his great uncle had on him growing up, calling him “the smartest person that I ever met in my own family. I believe his IQ was 180 or more. He had only six years of schooling, but he was breathtakingly brilliant. And in his old, old age he could remember the names of dogs he had owned 60 years earlier and things like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president said he credits his great uncle for teaching him his good people skills. “I listened and I learned that every person has a story and that every person can be inherently interesting if they're not too shy, or too scared, or too scripted, too controlled to block their own story,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton also seemed to forecast the divisive election cycle to come, where a brash and bullying&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;candidate has managed to become one of the presumptive nominees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our family when you were a child you could not tell a story until you proved you could listen to one,” Bill Clinton said. “And my aunt, my uncle, my grandparents, they would look at me and say, Bill, did you hear that? And I'd say, yes, I did. Did you understand it? I think so. What did you hear? And you would have to stand up and say what you heard. And I don't think so much of that happens anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those listening skills, he said: &amp;quot;I think that’s why I got elected president.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Trump's campaign dwarfed by Clinton's</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trumps-campaign-dwarfed-by-clintons-223438</link>
      <description>New FEC reports show that the likely Democratic nominee will start with a huge infrastructure advantage.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the general election, Hillary Clinton’s campaign looks like a well-oiled juggernaut next to Donald Trump’s vastly smaller, mostly self-funded operation, a POLITICO analysis of Federal Election Commission reports filed Friday found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the end of last month, the period covered by the most recent FEC filings, Trump’s campaign spending was less than a third of Clinton’s ($57 million to $182 million) and Trump had assembled a staff about one-tenth the size of hers (70 employees to 732), and spent less on offices (Trump last month paid $101,000 in rent vs. $328,000 for Clinton), the analysis found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump — a billionaire rookie candidate whose own money had accounted for 75 percent of the $59 million brought in by his campaign — is moving quickly to buttress his campaign operations, partly by launching a fundraising and field operation in coordination with the Republican National Committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did little to assemble the trappings of a traditional campaign during a chaotic primary in which he dispatched 16 rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, many of whom ran more traditional, and expensive, campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $57 million Trump had spent through the end of April is only slightly more than the $54 million spent by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/rubio-suspends-presidential-campaign-220827" target="_blank"&gt;dropped out of the race&lt;/a&gt; more than two months ago, and it’s far less than the $81 million spent by Ted Cruz. The Texas senator assembled a sophisticated microtargeting machine that helped keep him in the race until &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/ted-cruz-drops-out-of-presidential-race-222763" target="_blank"&gt;he dropped out&lt;/a&gt; this month, after being trounced by Trump in the Indiana primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, as Trump was &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/wisconsin-primary-2016-ted-cruz-donald-trump-221580" target="_blank"&gt;struggling to put away Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, Trump’s campaign spent $2.7 million on advertising, while Clinton spent $12 million on digital and broadcast media buys as she sought to put away her rival for the Democratic nomination Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Clinton’s campaign appeared to be preparing for the general election, spending far less than Sanders, whose $207 million in total spending marks him as the cycle’s biggest spender. He continued spending briskly in April, dropping $38.6 million, compared to $23.9 million by Clinton. Sanders spent almost twice as much as Clinton on media and payroll (despite a slightly smaller staff), as well as more on online advertising and direct mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Sanders entered this month with only $5.8 million in the bank, compared with Clinton’s $30 million. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, unlike either Sanders or Trump, both of whom have eschewed super PACs, Clinton is backed by the deep-pocketed Priorities USA Action. It raised &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/hillary-clinton-mega-donor-fundraising-223431" target="_blank"&gt;$8.6 million last month&lt;/a&gt;, more than a third of which came from Univision chairman Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl, according to its FEC report, which showed it finished last month with $47 million in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of super PACs are vying to raise big money for Trump, but they have gotten off to a slow start as they’ve &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-allies-rivalries-plagues-super-pacs-223300" target="_blank"&gt;struggled with infighting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Clinton also has a massive head start over Trump when it come to analytics, polling and building models of likely voters and turnout plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, who only &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-pollster-223251" target="_blank"&gt;recently hired a pollster&lt;/a&gt;, still had not spent a dime on polling through the end of last month, while Clinton spent $896,000 in April alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump did start beefing up other areas of his operation last month, his &lt;a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00580100/1074038/" target="_blank"&gt;FEC report&lt;/a&gt; showed. For instance, he spent $931,000 on direct mail, compared with only $398,000 spent by Clinton, according to &lt;a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00575795/1073673/" target="_blank"&gt;her report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Trump continued to be among the biggest spenders in the field on branded merchandise, including his signature Make America Great Again hats. His campaign last month spent $856,000 on hats, T-shirts, mugs and stickers, versus the $88,000 Clinton spent on merchandise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Donald Trump's map: The downside</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trumps-map-the-downside-223393</link>
      <description>Republicans haven't had to worry much about Arizona and Georgia in presidential elections. Until now.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The panic alarms aren’t sounding yet, but new polls in Arizona and Georgia are heightening GOP anxiety about the prospect that the two states, long reliably red at the presidential level, could bolt to Hillary Clinton in November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the downside of Donald Trump’s potential rewiring of the electoral map. Just as the presumptive Republican nominee shows signs he could pick off some longstanding Democratic Rust Belt states, his hard-line approach to immigration and controversial remarks about women and minorities run the risk of accelerating trends in Arizona and Georgia that could turn them blue for the first time in a generation — or at a minimum, make them competitive enough that Republicans are forced to play defense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton still faces uphill battles in both states. Georgia has voted Republican in seven of the past eight presidential elections. Arizona has voted for only one Democrat since Harry Truman in 1948. But interviews with more than a dozen elected officials, operatives and activists in both states suggest that the traditional calculus in those places may not apply this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very difficult for a Democrat statewide; several times they thought they could put a lot of money into it and turn it into a purple state,” said former Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl. “But this is a different year; certainly, if Hillary Clinton has a lot of money to spend, she could decide to put some in Arizona. Who knows what November will bring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgia, said Charlie Harper, a Peach State Republican who runs a policy think tank and writes a blog about state politics, “definitely has the potential to be competitive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still really don’t know enough about what kind of candidate we’re going to get out of Donald Trump,” he said. “Does the party consolidate around him? There is a lot of resistance to that, specifically, the Ted Cruz camp in Georgia, which is the organized anti-establishment establishment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Atlanta Journal-Constitution &lt;a href="http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/poll-clinton-vs-trump-a-tossup-between-unpopular-c/nrMhZ/" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; released Saturday&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; found Trump leading Clinton in Georgia by only 4 percentage points — within the margin of error. Two other surveys &lt;a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ga/georgia_trump_vs_clinton-5741.html" target="_blank"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; in the past month found Trump’s lead over Clinton ranging from 1 and 3 points. In Arizona, an automated poll from Public Policy Polling released Tuesday found Trump leading Clinton by just 4 percentage points, 45 percent to 41 percent. Another poll from April &lt;a href="http://www.brcpolls.com/16/RMP%202016-II-04.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; Clinton up by 7 points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of Trump’s problem is that, in addition to demographic challenges, he has more work to do than Clinton in uniting the GOP base. In Arizona, just 65 percent of Republicans say they’re comfortable with Trump as the nominee, according to the PPP survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a presidential level, it certainly should be in play,” said Brian Murray, a veteran Arizona Republican strategist, pointing to moderate Republican women who are troubled by Trump’s record of inflammatory gender-related remarks, and senior citizens who wonder whether Trump’s policy inconsistencies would extend to entitlements like Social Security and Medicare (Trump has promised to protect those programs). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the most pressing issue in Arizona is Trump’s relationship with Hispanic voters. While Republicans have the edge in voter registration in Arizona, Democrats and unaffiliated groups like OneArizona are working aggressively to register the booming Latino community, convinced that Trump’s heated rhetoric toward Hispanic immigrants is extreme enough that a demographic that has long been relatively dormant politically could turn out in significant numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A historically awful candidate, when it comes to Latinos, is going to motivate them to come out, especially young Latinos, which has always been a difficult demographic to get out,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). “With somebody like Trump on the ballot, they’re going to be self-motivated to come out.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, the Latino vote — which numbers just under 1 million eligible voters, &lt;a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/fact-sheets/2016-state-election-fact-sheets/latinos-in-the-2016-election-arizona/" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Pew Research Center — has failed to materialize in numbers significant enough to move the dial. But the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials &lt;a href="http://www.naleo.org/election2016#portfolioModal6" target="_blank"&gt;predicts&lt;/a&gt; an 8-percent increase in Latino turnout over 2012 in Arizona (when Mitt Romney carried the state by 10 points), and Democratic operatives and politicians insist that this time is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These candidates have made the choice so clear, so stark, I’m absolutely hearing people every day out in the field say, ‘I need to vote,’” said Ian Danley, executive director of OneArizona, a nonpartisan group that plans to register from 75,000 to 80,000 new, predominantly Latino voters this year as part of a broader registration effort. According to the group, it has registered about 10,000 voters since the beginning of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latinos and other Democratic voters&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;may have added incentive to turn out this fall: Controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, who was recently found in contempt of federal court over a racial profiling issue, is also on the ballot. His name is toxic in Arizona’s Latino community — and he has endorsed Trump. Republican Sen. John McCain has already privately &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-latinos-mccain-222810" target="_blank"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that with Trump at the top of the ticket, he also faces a competitive Senate race&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With a very weak Republican candidate who’s said offensive, racist things about the immigrant community, with the motivated base as it relates to getting rid of Sheriff Joe Arpaio here in Maricopa County, and with a strong U.S. Senate candidate to pull it all together, it’s going to be a good year here in Arizona for Secretary Clinton,” said Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, who like Gallego served on Clinton’s Arizona leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chad Willems, Arpaio’s campaign manager, is not convinced that Arizona is safe Republican territory for Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we had a Marco Rubio or a Jeb Bush at the top of the ticket, in the political world we could guess within a decent margin of error what turnout was going to be,” said Willems, noting that some Arizona Republicans are still troubled by Trump, though he expects many will ultimately get on board. “With Trump, there are too many unknowns at this point. It may fare well for Republicans, it may fare bad for Republicans.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just as Trump may motivate some Latinos to turn out for Clinton, Republicans point out that the New York billionaire could have a catalytic effect on Republicans. He won the state primary decisively and has a committed and enthusiastic fan base in Arizona. Trump also has numbers on his side: Republican have an advantage in voter registration over independents and Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There still won’t be enough Hispanics to make up the difference,” said a skeptical Sean Noble, an Arizona GOP operative who is not currently backing Trump. “For every additional Hispanic voter who shows up, there’s going to be a blue-collar Democrat who votes for Trump. He is resonating with low- and middle-income folks.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Georgia also&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;has a growing Latino population, it is African-American voter turnout that will play the decisive role in Clinton’s performance. It’s off to a promising start: The state Democratic Party last month unveiled a new field program&lt;a href="http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2016/04/08/how-democrats-plan-to-turn-georgia-into-a-battleground-state/" target="_blank"&gt;, paid for&lt;/a&gt; in part by major Democratic donor Philip Munger, son of Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charles Munger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You simply need to maximize your voters of color, essentially turn out your base and hold the white vote we’ve had since John Kerry,” the Democratic nominee in 2004, said Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams. “The impediment has been the [lack of] investment in turning out that base voter.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new field program and a minority base energized to vote against Trump — and for Clinton, who does well with African-American voters — Democrats are feeling increasingly optimistic, said Abrams and other leaders in the African-American community in Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Georgia is poised, in a real sense, demographically, to shift,” said Dr. Raphael Warnock, pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where Martin Luther King Jr. was co-pastor. Warnock is heavily involved in voter registration efforts. “It’s really just a matter of time, and not a lot of time. It’s conceivable [now] that you could have the right formula: Hillary Clinton is a name a lot of people know well. There’s a great deal of goodwill for the Clintons in the African-American community. That, coupled with concerns around Trump, makes it an interesting race.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much will depend on whether Republican voters decide to coalesce around Trump’s candidacy. Former Rep. Jack Kingston, who was an active Cruz supporter, said the Texas senator’s support is transferring to Trump at a “glacial” pace — but ultimately many Cruz supporters will rally to the New York billionaire, he predicted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think a lot of former Cruz and Rubio people aren’t giving Trump a big warm bearhug right now, but it will come,” said Kingston, who says he is now comfortable with Trump. “The three most inspiring words are ‘President Rodham Clinton.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss noted that Trump handily won the Georgia primary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In spite of Trump maybe making some statements that seem outlandish, I think there are a lot of people who identify with those statements, and I think he’s going to do very well here,” Chambliss said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope the Democrats believe,” he added, “that they should spend a hell of a lot of money down here.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Burgess Everett contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Why Donald Trump's poll numbers are surging</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-poll-surge-223419</link>
      <description>He makes major gains among Republicans, while Clinton drops among Democrats.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Trump Bump has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After wrapping up an acutely fractious primary in which Donald Trump and his opponents lobbed scores of personal, playground insults at one another, the presumptive GOP nominee has quickly unified the vast majority of Republican voters around one goal: defeating Hillary Clinton, his prospective Democratic opponent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering the general election &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-begins-in-a-massive-hole-222816" target="_blank"&gt;trailing by about 7 points&lt;/a&gt;, Trump has rapidly erased most of that gap: As of Friday, Clinton’s advantage was down to roughly 2 points, according to the &lt;a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton" target="_blank"&gt;HuffPost Pollster average&lt;/a&gt;. And some polls, like a &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2016/05/18/fox-news-poll-2016-national-release-may-18/" target="_blank"&gt;Fox News survey&lt;/a&gt; out on Wednesday, show Trump inching ahead of Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason for Trump’s surge over the past few weeks? He is earning increasingly larger shares of the Republican vote — even as some prominent GOP leaders, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, haven’t yet committed to supporting their party’s apparent nominee. But rank-and-file Republican voters are lining up behind Trump in large numbers, closing the gap with Clinton’s support among Democrats, which had been higher during earlier stages of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Republican voters are consolidating around Trump, and it’s been beneficial to him not to have other Republican opponents constantly attacking him,” said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, who advises the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data point to a close race in the fall, with about a dozen or so states likely to be decisive in the Electoral College — all consistent with recent history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Fox News national poll, Trump led Clinton among all registered voters, 45 percent to 42 percent – a reversal from last month, when Clinton had a 7-point lead, 48 percent to 41 percent. In the new Fox poll, Clinton wins 83 percent of self-identified Democrats, while Trump takes 82 percent of Republicans. Trump’s lead is built on a 16-point edge among independents, 46 percent to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/313215594/CBS-NYT-Poll-Toplines-May" target="_blank"&gt;CBS News/New York Times poll&lt;/a&gt; conducted over roughly the same period found Clinton up by 6 points, 47 percent to 41 percent. But, like the Fox poll, Clinton earns roughly the same percentage of Democrats (88 percent) as Trump does of Republicans (85 percent). The CBS News/New York Times poll, unlike Fox, showed a tied race among independents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the states, polls over the past two weeks in &lt;a href="https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/2016-presidential-swing-state-polls/release-detail?ReleaseID=2345" target="_blank"&gt;Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.wbur.org/2016/05/18/wbur-poll-clinton-trump-new-hampshire" target="_blank"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/05/mccain-in-deep-trouble-in-gop-primary-trump-clinton-close-in-az.html" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/poll-clinton-vs-trump-a-tossup-between-unpopular-c/nrMhZ/" target="_blank"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; all showed the candidates locked within 5 points. Together, these states alone are worth 98 electoral votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other data also point to Trump’s consolidation of Republicans — combined with, or perhaps because of, Clinton’s unpopularity — as the primary driver behind a tightening race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallup has been tracking the candidates’ images among their own partisans — and interviews over the past week, conducted May 12-18, find Trump as popular among &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/189299/presidential-election-2016-key-indicators.aspx?g_source=ELECTION_2016&amp;amp;g_medium=topic&amp;amp;g_campaign=tiles#pcf-fave" target="_blank"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; (65 percent favorable/30 percent unfavorable) as Clinton is among &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/189299/presidential-election-2016-key-indicators.aspx?g_source=ELECTION_2016&amp;amp;g_medium=topic&amp;amp;g_campaign=tiles#pcf-dems" target="_blank"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (66 percent favorable/29 percent unfavorable).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s solidification of the Republican vote is only half the story, however. The Gallup data show Clinton sliding among Democrats: She dropped four points in the week between Gallup's two most recent surveys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both candidates remain historically unpopular among the broader pool of all Americans: The &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/189299/presidential-election-2016-key-indicators.aspx?g_source=ELECTION_2016&amp;amp;g_medium=topic&amp;amp;g_campaign=tiles#pcf-image" target="_blank"&gt;Gallup data&lt;/a&gt; show Trump with only a 34-percent favorable rating among all adults, compared to 39 percent for Clinton. Majorities have unfavorable opinions of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among independent voters, Trump's numbers have improved since he vanquished his remaining GOP rivals in the Indiana primary on May 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His number among Republicans certainly is getting better. And that’s going to be a key, holding that vote,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in New Jersey. “But, right now, independents are looking at this populist message, and it’s resonating a little, at least while Democrats are fighting among themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway noted other improvements in Trump's numbers, including the fact that he's tied in the Fox News poll with Clinton among voters with a college degree and was winning 35 percent of voters younger than 35. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Trump's recent polling gains represent both a coalescing of rank-and-file Republican voters and portend a broader trend. It is not just simply among Republicans where he is developing support,&amp;quot; Conway said, adding that Trump &amp;quot;has made great gains in the process of unifying the party behind his candidacy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Trump has undeniably surged, it’s also likely he remains behind Clinton. Excluding surveys from the automated pollster Rasmussen Reports, which has been significantly biased toward Republicans in the past, Trump’s lead in the Fox News poll was his first advantage over Clinton since a &lt;a href="http://www.suffolk.edu/news/64929.php" target="_blank"&gt;Suffolk University/USA Today poll&lt;/a&gt; conducted immediately following Trump’s victory in the New Hampshire primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton’s allies claim the tightening in the race is natural, and they always expected Trump to challenge Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said several weeks ago, ‘This is going to a close and competitive election,’” said Garin. “That wasn’t spin. That was our honest assessment of what the race is likely to be. To me, there’s nothing particularly shocking or surprising that recent polls show the trial heat to be closer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just as anti-Clinton sentiments have helped Trump unify Republicans, Democrats expect the same to happen when their nominating process concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s certain that Clinton would benefit from putting the intra-party divisiveness behind her in the same way that Trump has benefited from that on his side,” Garin said. “Polling in 2008 reflected a unification among Democrats after the last primary as a result of Hillary expressing her support for Obama and encouraging her own supporters to also get behind him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conway, the GOP pollster, disagreed, noting that Clinton's numbers among Democrats have been sliding as the race has neared the finish line, as opposed to Trump's, which ticked up as time went on. And Trump, Conway said, had more room to grow among GOP voters than Clinton will have with Democrats once she wraps up the nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She has been stronger among Democrats than he has been among Republicans for a while now,&amp;quot; said Conway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Clinton herself is still making the argument that the party will unify in the general election to defeat a common enemy, just as Republicans appear to be uniting now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think what brings us together is Donald Trump,” Clinton said Thursday in an interview with CNN. “I think that’s what brings us together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>How a deadly tropical virus became another Washington mess</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/zika-congress-funding-fight-223418</link>
      <description>Democrats say Republicans are risking an outbreak of Zika, a disease that threatens the developing brains of fetuses.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Even pregnant women have become fodder for partisan Washington funding fights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With nearly 300 pregnant women in the United States already infected with the Zika virus and the summer mosquito season looming after a soggy spring, Congress has yet to approve&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the Obama administration’s 3-month-old, $1.9 billion request for emergency funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bipartisan response to previous public health crises, such as the 2014 Ebola outbreak and the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, is not evident in the months-long congressional debates about Zika, despite its huge human costs. The virus in pregnant women has been closely linked to severe brain abnormalities in fetuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A disease that destroys babies’ brains in utero is everyone’s worst nightmare — I’m not sure what could be much worse than that,” said Cindy Pellegrini, a senior vice president at March of Dimes, which is lobbying for the Zika funding. “But there doesn’t seem to be a sense of urgency on Capitol Hill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zika debate is caught up in election year politics and general GOP opposition to emergency spending. But there is another huge factor at play with Zika. Many congressional Republicans say they feel burned by the Obama administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014. In hindsight, the emergency response to that crisis was overfunded, they say, and now the White House is reluctant to reallocate all of the leftover money. Congress doesn't want to give another blank check on Zika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looked at what happened with Ebola — it looks like they asked for more than they needed,” said &lt;a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51870" target="_blank"&gt;Sen. Richard Burr&lt;/a&gt; (R-N.C.), who backed the Senate’s $1.1 billion deal on Zika and is perhaps the most prominent Republican defender of public health and emergency preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration and congressional Democrats say that by refusing to put up the money, Republicans are recklessly playing with fire on a health crisis that threatens the developing brains of fetuses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I listen to all of the really well-meaning people talking about the rights of the unborn and here we have a health crisis that dramatically impacts the unborn,&amp;quot; said Democratic Sen. &lt;a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51843" target="_blank"&gt;Claire McCaskill&lt;/a&gt; of Missouri. &amp;quot;It seems to me we should be doing a much more aggressive job of making sure the resources that our health experts say that we need are in place.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, there are 157 pregnant women in the continental United States and 122 in the U.S. territories — mostly Puerto Rico — with a confirmed Zika diagnosis who risk giving birth to babies with microcephaly, a birth defect where a baby's head is unusually small and the brain is underdeveloped, according to a CDC report issued Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama was briefed on Zika developments Friday and warned that the crisis is &amp;quot;something we need to take seriously.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is not something where you can build a wall to prevent,&amp;quot; he said. “Congress needs to get me a bill. It needs to get me a bill that has sufficient funds to do the job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, all the cases in pregnant women in the continental United States involve women who traveled abroad or more rarely, who were infected by men who traveled to Zika hot spots. The virus is being transmitted locally by mosquitoes in the territories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But public health experts expect that local transmission of the virus through mosquitoes will&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;spread&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to the continental United States — mostly the Southern states — this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zika is a big deal. It scares the heck out of me and all of us,” said Rep. &lt;a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51356" target="_blank"&gt;Mario Diaz-Balart&lt;/a&gt;, a Republican whose South Florida district could face the brunt of the virus. “So we’re going to do whatever it takes. Having said that, we don’t want to do another ‘shovel-ready’ fiasco,” he said, referring to mismanaged projects funded by the 2009 stimulus package. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama administration officials say they’ve been trying to get ahead of Zika for three months, while a Republican-controlled Congress appears to slow-walk the process by asking for&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;impossible details about how money will be spent on given weeks on a virus that public health experts are still trying to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our initial understanding of this was that this was going to be treated as an emergency and that it would be funded that way,” said one administration official. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is, I think, a legitimate lack of understanding” about how emergency funding works among some House members, the official added. “What they’re asking us for … they’re not things that we would be able to answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those questions weren't raised during the emergency responses to Ebola, the H1N1 virus or Avian flu, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration says the Department of Health and Human Services and USAID need more cash to contain Zika’s spread here through mosquito control, to develop better tests and speed vaccine development and to expand Medicaid coverage in Puerto Rico, where heat, humidity and poverty make it ground zero for a U.S. outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans want to see more funding set aside in the regular appropriations process to deal with crises. Burr accused the White House of underfunding emergency preparedness accounts in the regular budget process — funds that are supposed to be set each year to deal with crises like Zika. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final approval of any kind of Zika funding appears unlikely to get to the president’s desk until next month at the earliest. But the timeline is tight: Congress leaves in mid-July and doesn’t return until September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the House voted to fund about one-third of the $1.9 billion request — an effort the White House considered&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;so paltry it said it may veto it. And the Senate backed a $1.1 billion package attached to unrelated legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51281" target="_blank"&gt;Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri,&lt;/a&gt; the lead negotiator in the Senate, said he expects both chambers to pass stand-alone bills and move to conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll resolve this as quickly as we can but I would be surprised if it happens next week,” Blunt said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Congress is unlikely to approve the full amount the White House requested. For instance, Blunt said he has already eliminated $85 million the administration sought for building construction that is hardly an emergency. The construction request was in an earlier Zika proposal but has since been deleted, according to an administration official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Republicans want the Zika money to sunset if the virus is contained and ensure that it can’t become a &amp;quot;slush fund&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; if money is left over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A central point of disagreement is how quickly the money is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has already moved about $600 million in Ebola funding to Zika. Republicans say by the time that money is gone, or sooner, there will be an appropriation in the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. The administration argues it needs the money as quickly as possible to get working on its response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two camps also don’t agree on whether the threat from Ebola has actually been eliminated. House Republicans say the Ebola outbreak is over so that funding can be moved. But the administration says that accomplishment is still tenuous, with occasional Ebola cases prompting a forceful response to prevent its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $1 billion in Ebola funds remain unspent. Less than $200 million of that hasn't been allocated, according to the Obama administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $500 million has already been allocated to a global health effort to help West Africa and dozens of other undeveloped countries shore up health care infrastructure to prevent another outbreak of Ebola or any other disease, according to an administration official. Congress specifically allocated that money to be spent over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unspent funding is also going toward tracking Ebola survivors — the virus could spread though semen for months after symptoms disappear — and preventing small flareups from spreading into another serious outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, there were 13 Ebola cases and 1,700 vaccinations issued in Guinea and Liberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sarah Wheaton contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Melania Trump of the 19th Century</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/melania-trump-19th-century-louisa-adams-first-lady-213908</link>
      <description>Louisa Adams was America’s first and last immigrant first lady—and her political opponents never let her forget it.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At a party one night in Washington in 1819, Louisa Catherine Adams was speaking with a few members of Congress from Western states when the subject turned to politics. Wary, she responded “in a jesting way,” as she later told her father-in-law, John Adams. She knew the men were not interested in her opinions about the issues. They were interested in learning whether she had opinions at all—whether she would cross the line that divided the women from the men, the pure from the political, the American parlor from the European court. It was a trap. She was being tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisa’s husband, John Quincy Adams, was then the secretary of state—considered the heir apparent to the president. But it was a time of change. Populist sentiment was rising. More and more men were getting the vote, and fewer and fewer trusted the established order. The very notion of an heir apparent smacked of Europe—and monarchy. John Quincy was vulnerable to such attacks, not only as the son of a former president, but also as a former diplomat in European courts. And he was even more vulnerable because of where his wife was from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Donald Trump becomes president, his wife, Melania, who was born in what’s now Slovenia, will become the second foreign-born first lady in the history of the United States. Louisa Catherine Johnson Adams, whose husband was elected president in 1824, was the first. Although Melania’s origins have made her the object of some interest during the 2016 campaign, no one has used them to argue against Trump’s claim to the White House, or even his well-known views on immigration. But that was not the case with Louisa—whose birthplace was used as a weapon against both her and her husband. To John Quincy’s political opponents, Louisa’s origins implied that she and her husband were undemocratic, tainted by the Old World, antithetical to the new republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in London in 1775, Louisa in fact became an American at a young age. Her mother, Catherine, was English, but her father, Joshua, was a proud American patriot who had come to London from Annapolis to set up business as a merchant. Joshua’s brother Thomas even served as Maryland’s first governor and as a delegate to the Continental Congress. Louisa herself was naturalized as a citizen of Maryland when she was 9. She was raised to think of herself as American—and, more importantly, to marry one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she did not set foot in the United States until she was 26, and by then, she had lived in Britain, France and Prussia. She was fluent in French, familiar with the strange customs of Silesian country inns, and had watched Dutch sailors suck sugar from a string as they drank tea aboard ship. After she was engaged to John Quincy, even he admitted privately to his mother, Abigail—who considered Louisa a “fine lady,” frail and vaguely alien—that Louisa was not “wholly American.” Louisa herself did not wholly disagree. “In short I was in every respect any thing but what I should have been,” she once wrote in a memoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a fine lady with a canny political intelligence wouldn’t have helped Louisa on a New England farm of the kind Abigail Adams oversaw in Massachusetts. But that background was immensely helpful in Washington social circles, where Louisa could throw a party, converse, dance and charm. Still, there were dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that party in 1819, one of the Western congressmen drew himself up and told Louisa “that he was an honest man and totally unacquainted with diplomatic tricks.” The implication—and the attack on her behind it—was clear. European courts were associated with tyranny, debauchery, aristocracy and effeminate luxury. The powerful women in them were particularly despised. They meddled with politics; they were corrupting and corruptible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Jefferson, for instance, had been shocked when he saw how women “mix promiscuously in gatherings of men” in Paris. He would form friendships with some of them but remained suspicious of women in power. “I have ever believed that had there been no queen there would have been no [French] Revolution,” he wrote in his autobiography. Female courtiers were suspected of being capable of ruining a country, both morally and financially. They were seen at once as too weak and too dangerously powerful, capable of “omnipotent influence,” in the words of one American founder. Marie Antoinette was not the only one. When the French-Swiss writer Madame de Stael’s book &lt;i&gt;Delphine &lt;/i&gt;reached American shores at the start of the 19th century, everyone read it, and buzzed about its scandalous defense of divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I find myself an object of continual suspicion and mistrust,” Louisa wrote to her father-in-law, John Adams, after the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisa was scrutinized especially closely because, as secretary of state, John Quincy was among a small handful of serious presidential candidates who emerged as soon as James Monroe became president.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;As Adams’ campaign—unacknowledged by him in an era during which “electioneering” was considered craven—gained force, Louisa’s experience in Europe followed her like a shadow. There was the rumor that circulated around Washington that the British prince regent had asked her and John Quincy to stand as proxy for him at the christening of the British minister’s child; Monroe even asked John Quincy if it was true. Louisa’s parties, which made the Adams house the center of Washington’s social scene—and kept John Quincy at the center of attention, even as he claimed to spurn it—were used as evidence of her aristocratic tendencies and her political ambition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks on Louisa’s origins only intensified—and became more public—after her husband was elected president in 1824 and the couple moved into the White House. Supporters of Andrew Jackson, the U.S. senator from Tennessee who had run against John Quincy, immediately launched what would become their 1828 campaign—and this time they openly attacked John Quincy by attacking his wife, insinuating that Louisa was not a genuine American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisa was sensitive to the implications and sought to insulate herself from them. After a rare visit to her relatives in Maryland, she wrote to them asking for anything in her uncle Thomas’ papers that might help establish her American lineage. “The electioneering canvas calls forth questions which make this a question of high importance to me,” she wrote. In 1827, a kind of campaign biography of Louisa appeared in the &lt;i&gt;Philadelphia Evening Post&lt;/i&gt;—anonymously, but, as her critics charged, “manifestly written by Mrs. Adams herself.” Its goal, the article stated, was to put an end to the rumors that the president’s wife was not American and to establish, instead, that “Mrs. Adams is the daughter of an American Republican Merchant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the article was a gross miscalculation—an unwitting articulation of some of Louisa’s greatest insecurities and an account of her success in Europe. The tone was even a little deranged, perhaps suggesting something of Louisa’s state of mind at the time. And it gave Jackson’s supporters ample ammunition. When a pro-Adams paper in turn called Jackson an adulterer and a bigamist, claiming that his wife, Rachel, had been married but not divorced before living with Andrew, the Jackson forces read the two articles about the candidates’ wives as a coordinated, malicious attack on Rachel. The leading opposition paper, the &lt;i&gt;United States Telegraph&lt;/i&gt;, said Louisa’s biography was written “to contrast her courtly education with that of Mrs. Jackson, and to demonstrate how much better qualified she was to discharge the duties of the drawing room than the unassuming, plain, old housewife of the Tennessee Farmer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Telegraph &lt;/i&gt;launched an attack on Louisa in retaliation, mocking her for trying to appear “unambitious,” with “retiring manners” and “republican virtues and connections.” Day after day, the paper derided her attempt to appear as an “unassuming” woman “detesting politics.” As the attacks grew more vicious, the &lt;i&gt;Telegraph &lt;/i&gt;claimed to know the “truths” about Louisa’s background. The paper’s editorialist even declared he had no desire to print what everyone knew, information about Louisa’s “mother’s family,” which had vices that, “though found in the higher circles of Europe, are confined in this country to the most degraded and abandoned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Jackson told the &lt;i&gt;Telegraph&lt;/i&gt;’s&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;editor, Duff Green, to leave Louisa—and women generally—out of his attacks, and the paper dialed back.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;But of course in politics there is no stopping anything once started. A year later, as the campaign went on, a representative from Massachusetts, Edward Everett, gave a speech on the House floor refuting, while at the same time airing, charges that while living in St. Petersburg, Louisa had presented her maid, Martha Godfrey, for the pleasure of the tsar of Russia. “It seems that this election is to blast the election of every member of the family,” Louisa wrote to her son Charles. “I am sick of the world.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In one sense, Louisa, despite her British origins &lt;/b&gt;and European experience, absorbed and reflected many of the expectations that restrained American women in her time. Today, a first lady has her own suite of offices and staff; she is expected to have an issue or cause to champion, and she is allowed to have opinions. But in Louisa’s time, the president’s wife was expected to stay out of the public eye—which is part of what made her social presence, and the insinuations of her hunger for power, so controversial. The truth is Louisa did not shape John Quincy’s policies; she did not think it was her place. She had little to do but host levees—highly ritualized receptions for whomever cared to call (servants and slaves excepted). In the White House, she spent much of her time in her room, eating chocolate, translating French poetry and dwelling on her sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But—in part because she was always caught between places and people, in part because she lived in a country that was not quite her own—Louisa had a preternatural sensitivity, which became a strength. She did not take positions on John Quincy’s positions, but she did help him see himself as others did. The “great impulse of civil society,” she once wrote to him, is largely governed by “little every day feelings”—not only laws written by great men. John Quincy had just been falsely attacked, his correspondence doctored by a political rival and published, and he was belaboring his defense in minute detail long after he had won his point. “You are under a great error,” Louisa gently told him. “The personal&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;part of it has been the only part which has really occupied the publick mind, and it has placed you before the world in the character of a private individual.” At other times, she helped him see how blunt he could be, how harsh and how cold. In this sense, Louisa reflected the expectations of a modern-day first lady: the one person who speaks her mind to the president—who tells him how it really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melania Trump, who grew up in communist Yugoslavia before she became a model and then Donald’s third wife, in no way typifies the traditional American spouse. Partly for that reason perhaps, until recently she has been almost absent from the presidential campaign. Her non-American roots have been discussed in &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gq.com/story/melania-trump-gq-interview" target="_blank"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/09/who-is-melania-trump" target="_blank"&gt;profiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, but not as marks against her husband’s candidacy or potential influences on his policy positions: Those who hope that, as an immigrant, she might be a moderating influence on her husband’s xenophobic immigration statements are clearly dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in some ways, despite her foreign birth, Melania typifies the old conventions. She presents herself (and is presented) as devoted to her son, decorative and mostly silent. She says that she is unafraid to speak her mind. “I like to know exactly what’s going on,” she &lt;a href="http://dujour.com/news/melania-trump-interview/" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;i&gt;DuJour &lt;/i&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt; in a recent interview. “I give a lot of advice to my husband and tell him how it is and how I see it. I’m not backing off. I tell him the truth.” At least in public, however, she is offered as the crown jewel of the brand, an ornament—which would have been a compliment in Louisa’s time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Train That Saved Denver</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/what-works-denver-rail-system-growth-213905</link>
      <description>The car-choked city overcame regional distrust to build a major transit system that is remaking the urban core and the suburbs, too.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, travelers arriving at Denver’s sprawling new airport would look out over a vast expanse of flat, prairie dog-infested grassland and wonder if their plane had somehow fallen short of its destination. The $4.9 billion airport—at 53 square miles, larger than Manhattan—was derided as being “halfway to Kansas,” and given the emptiness of the 23-mile drive to the city, it felt that way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, arriving visitors boarded the first trains headed for downtown, a journey that zips past a new Japanese-style “smart city” emerging from the prairie before depositing passengers 37 minutes later in a bustling urban hive of restaurants, shops and residential towers that only six years ago was a gravelly no man’s land—an entire $2 billion downtown neighborhood that’s mushroomed up around the hub of Denver’s rapidly expanding light rail system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 22.8-mile spur from the airport to downtown is the latest addition to a regional rail system that has transformed Denver and its suburbs. Using an unprecedented public-private partnership that combines private funding, local tax dollars and federal grants, Denver has done something no other major metro area has accomplished in the past decade, though a number of cities have tried. At a moment when aging mass transit systems in several major cities are capturing headlines for mismanagement, chronic delays and even deaths, Denver is unveiling a shiny new and widely praised network: 68 stations along 10 different spurs, covering 98 miles, with another 15 miles still to come. Even before the new lines opened, 77,000 people were riding light rail &lt;a href="http://www.apta.com/resources/statistics/Pages/ridershipreport.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;each day&lt;/a&gt;, making it the eighth-largest system in the country even though Denver is not in the top 20 cities for population. The effects on the region’s quality of life have been measurable and also surprising, even to the project’s most committed advocates. Originally intended to unclog congested highways and defeat a stubborn brown smog that was as unhealthy as it was ugly, the new rail system has proven that its greatest value is the remarkable changes in land use its stations have prompted, from revitalizing moribund neighborhoods, like the area around Union Station, to creating new communities where once there was only sprawl or buffalo grass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are talking about a culture-transforming moment,” says Denver mayor Michael Hancock. “Light rail has really moved Denver into the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our adolescence is over, and we’ve matured to adulthood,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the $7.6 billion FasTracks project saved Denver from a dreaded fate locals call “Houstonization” is the story of regional cooperation that required the buy-in of businesspeople, elected officials, civil servants and environmentalists across a region the size of Delaware. Their ability to work collectively—and the public’s willingness to approve major taxpayer investments—has created a transit system that is already altering Denver’s perception of itself, turning an auto-centric city into a higher-density, tightly-integrated urban center that aims to outcompete the bigger, older coastal cities on the global stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think Denver could disrupt Silicon Valley as the hotbed of innovative technologies,” says Stuart Wall, the New York-based CEO of Signpost, an automated, small-business platform provider, which opened a 30-person office in a former stable near a downtown light rail station two years ago. “San Francisco has an oversupply of tech firms and is enormously expensive. If I were to do it all over again, I would consider having our headquarters here and our satellite office in New York.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Denver has been storming national rankings lists: Brookings Institution demographer William Frey’s &lt;a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2011/10/28-young-adults-frey" target="_blank"&gt;best&lt;/a&gt; (2011) and &lt;a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Opinions/2013/11/15-frey/FreyTable1a.pdf?la=en" target="_blank"&gt;second best&lt;/a&gt; (2013) city for attracting millennials; the best city for college graduates (2014, Apartments.com); the largest increase in residents with college degrees (U.S. Census, 2014); the best commercial real estate market (Coldwell Banker, 2015); the second best for launching a startup (2014, Forbes); and, this year, &lt;i&gt;U.S. News and World Report&lt;/i&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://realestate.usnews.com/places/colorado/denver" target="_blank"&gt;best place to live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve become a top destination for millennials, and FasTracks is a significant part of that,” says Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, who championed the expansion of rail transit as Denver’s mayor in the mid ‘aughts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it all happened, Hickenlooper and others note, because Coloradans across the base of the Front Range were willing to set aside crippling rivalries and make some big collective investments in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The interior West’s reputation&lt;/b&gt; as a bastion of libertarian individualism has always been overblown. Going it alone was impractical in a region so remote from markets, so bereft of navigable rivers or farmable land, so populated with Native American peoples strong enough to resist usurpers that it stopped yeoman farmers and herdsmen in their tracks. Settlement here was largely dependent on railroads, ore smelters, mining equipment, dams, large-scale irrigation projects and fortified military posts. And those things didn’t happen without capital from distant corporations—the Central Pacific, the Hearsts, Anaconda Copper, for example—or on the federal government, which owned and still owns much of the land. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The West is a semi-arid area and sometimes you can have harsh conditions even down here below the mountains,” says Governor Hickenlooper, who is fond of noting that barn raisings were more common than shootouts. “What really allowed the West to be settled was the wagon train, where everyone is organized, working together, and has their own chores and tasks. That’s how individuals survived.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People,” he notes, “have a broader self-interest than they often think they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denver exhibited this ethos from the outset. In 1866, eight years after the gold mining base camp was founded on the banks of the South Platte River, residents received the crushing news that the Transcontinental Railroad would bypass them in favor of Cheyenne, 100 miles to the north in Wyoming, where the mountains were easier to traverse. In response, Denver’s 4,800 residents raised nearly $1 million to construct a spur to Cheyenne, a three-year project that cemented the town’s status as the metropolis of the mountain west. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re still the most isolated major metro in the country, the only one for 600 miles in any direction,” notes Ken Schroeppel, an urban planning professor at the University of Colorado Denver. “We’ve always had to be really self-reliant because we’re kind of out here in the middle of this vast part of the country by ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked to Chicago and the coasts by the Denver Pacific, the city boomed, growing twenty-six-fold in as many years. When &lt;i&gt;Baedeker&lt;/i&gt;—the &lt;i&gt;Frommer’s Guide&lt;/i&gt; of the era—visited in 1892, Denver had invested in paving many of its principal streets. A network of cable and electric streetcars fanned out “for all parts of the city” from where Union Station now stands  and narrow-gauge rail service departed to Arvada, Golden and beyond. The city developed along the streetcar corridors, the suburbs along the light rail lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail transit investments and regional cooperation fell apart after World War II, like it did elsewhere in America. Governments at all levels encouraged highway and road construction and cars became widely available, enabling flight to the new suburbs that kept advancing across the prairie. Nationally, a holding company controlled by General Motors, Standard Oil and Firestone Tire gobbled up city streetcar companies with the goal of converting them to buses. The Denver Tramway Company, which operated 160 miles of track in its heyday, converted to diesel buses in 1950 and paved over its lines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the early 1970s, the baleful effects of these decisions were clear. Downtown Denver featured blocks of surface parking lots where once had stood historic homes and buildings. Traffic congestion kept growing and the city took over the bankrupt Denver Tramway Company. The relationship between the stagnating city and rapidly growing counties was competitive and often confrontational, even as an energy boom attracted people and investors to the region. Air pollution from automobiles was becoming hard to ignore, especially in the winter of 1971-72, when carbon monoxide levels broke federal standards on 108 of 183 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Then two cataclysms&lt;/b&gt; struck that brought the Denver region together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first was the oil bust of 1983, a precipitous collapse in world petroleum prices that hit Denver like a neutron bomb. Exxon and other energy firms packed up shop and downtown office vacancies exceeded 30 percent, even as commercial rents fell by nearly half. The housing market tumbled. “The whole region was decimated and it was by far the worst recession since the Great Depression and far worse than the most recent one we’ve had,” says Schroeppel of the University of Colorado Denver. “There’s nothing like a really bad crisis to get people to see beyond their petty disputes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic development consultant Tom Clark arrived in town in the middle of the crisis. “We lost what little corporate leadership we had: They were running district offices and they just left town,” he recalls. “The head of the &lt;i&gt;Denver Post&lt;/i&gt; left to run the &lt;i&gt;L.A. Times&lt;/i&gt;. What we had left was the merchant class, those who depended on the area economy for a living.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After three years of finger-pointing trying to figure out who the hell screwed this up so we can drag them into the city square and tie them up and spit on them, people realized it didn’t matter; we had to move forward,” Clark, now CEO of the Metro Denver Economic Development Corp., says. “They looked around and they said: ‘This place has been boom and bust for as long as we can remember. The Gold rush. The silver boom. The three-legged stool economy of Coors, carbon and the Cold War, where the only one that was stable was Coors. We’re sick of this.’ So we got serious about diversity in the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was a great pact organized by the metropolitan chamber of commerce. All the cities and towns in the nine-county region agreed not to poach jobs and businesses from one another, but rather to work together within Clark’s economic development corporation to attract opportunities to the region or push for major collective investments like a proper transit system or a new airport to replace the aging Stapleton Airport. “The idea was that as we work together, everyone will get their fair share in the long run and collectively we’ll all gain by making the pie bigger,” Schroeppel notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No more moving around the chairs in the Titanic,” Clark recalls. “And the ethics were: If you steal from someone else, you’re out of the family forever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second disaster was in the air. The “Brown Cloud,” a dense haze of smog that blotted out the mountains for weeks on end, was reckoned by some measures to be the most severe in the nation. Caused largely by automobile emissions that had been rising steadily since the early 70s and the sand spread on winter roads, the Cloud was harming residents’ health, scaring off visitors and threatening millions of dollars in federal highway funds if federal pollution standards weren’t met. The day of reckoning had come. “There’s a feeling that we don’t have it made the way we did a few years ago, and a recognition that we’re not going to get back on an upward economic development spiral if we don’t do anything about air quality,” the head of the governor’s Metropolitan Air Quality Council, Michael Schonbrun, told a visiting &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; reporter in 1986. “We were pretty slow in getting religion, but we certainly have religion now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region took a range of actions to deal with the Brown Cloud, from restrictions on burning wood to mandatory emissions tests and the infusion of extra oxygen in winter gas, which helped engines burn cleanly in the thin air of a city that’s 5,600 feet above sea level. The measures worked, but the region kept growing, accelerated in part by the arrival of technology and aerospace companies. Civic leaders banded together in a successful campaign for a 0.1 percent regional sales tax to support cultural institutions like the zoo, performing arts center and botanical gardens. One effort brought together the twin imperatives of retooling the regional economy and cleaning the skies: building metro Denver a world-class transit system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;At the outset,&lt;/b&gt; the Regional Transportation District had two strikes against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it had lost the trust of voters who in 1973 had approved a 0.5 percent sales tax increase in exchange for improvements to its lackluster bus system and the creation of a whiz-bang network of four-passenger “personal rapid transit” rail cars. “RTD’s inability to keep a clear and straightforward promise, together with its unforgiving collection of taxes morally tethered to that promise did not set well with the community at large,” the late Jack McCroskey, RTD’s former chair, wrote in his sharp-elbowed history of the era, &lt;i&gt;Light Rail and Heavy Politics&lt;/i&gt;. Getting citizens to support another sales tax hike—even a smaller one—was nigh impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, an army of critics insisted rail was a dead letter. “They loudly proclaimed that Colorado was not New York or Philadelphia or Boston, where people embraced and used mass transit; this was Colorado, where the car was king and transit was an unacceptable alternative,” RTD head Cal Marsella, who died in March, later recalled. “They eagerly awaited the opening of this 'boondoggle' so that they could verify their predictions of empty rail cars and empty parking lots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prove the critics wrong RTD issued $116 million in bonds to pay for a pilot project, a mere 5 miles of light rail. The line ran south toward the sprawl, ending in a giant parking lot in a former industrial zone under Interstate 25. On opening day in October 1994, everyone at RTD held their breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ridership was off the charts almost immediately, and within five years it had quadrupled our original projections,” says RTD staff historian John Elias. Denverites loved the train. Buoyed by this success, RTD two years later won a $120 million grant to extend the line 8.7 miles southwest to Littleton, a $174 million project that would be completed in 2000 and more than doubled its expected first-year ridership forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before shovels had dug into the ground, however, the district was campaigning for the Holy Grail: voter approval for a new 0.4 percent sales tax surcharge to pay for a $6 billion region-wide system. Voters rejected the proposal 58-42 in 1997, devastating transit boosters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those boosters was the owner of a brewery pub in slowly gentrifying Lower Downtown. John Hickenlooper had often looked across Wynkoop Street at the half-derelict Union Station and dreamed of trains from across the Front Range disgorging customers straight to his dining tables. “I was shocked, and a lot of us said part of why it failed was that the suburbs and city hadn’t been working together on this,” he recalls. “I’d never run for student council or class president, but I decided to run for mayor.” He won the open position in the 2003 election, and proceeded to play the role of RTD ambassador to his 33 counterparts across the region in an effort to build support for a truly regional system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance, he learned, boiled down to this: “My little suburban enclave won’t have light rail coming to it, so why should my citizens pay this tax?” Backed by a set of traffic management studies, Hickenlooper argued to suburban residents that their taxes would encourage tens of thousands of drivers to get off the road and out of their way. An advertising campaign—financed by the economic development corporation—focused on commute times: “Stuck in Traffic? FasTracks is the Answer.” Along the existing line to Littleton, the message was reinforced daily by the light rail trains racing past stalled rush hour traffic on I-25 and Route 85. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The unanimous support of the region’s mayors to support the FasTracks initiative was huge,” recalls Dave Genova, who was an RTD safety manager at the time and now heads the agency. “What we’d learned from the 1997 initiative was that people needed tangible details, comprehensive information about what they would be receiving and what it would mean to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Election Day 2004, the 0.4 percent sales tax referendum passed 58 percent to 42 percent—a perfect reversal of the failed vote seven years before—providing enough revenue to fund 122 miles of new rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit and 21,000 new parking spaces at stations. Supporters—an unlikely coalition of mayors, business leaders and environmentalists—celebrated at a victory party at a bar in Union Station, which the RTD had purchased three years earlier and was now poised to resume its status as the region’s central transportation hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Then it all came&lt;/b&gt; crashing down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial collapse of 2007 and Great Recession threw RTD’s sales tax projections out the window, with its revenues falling short by $4.6 billion by 2009. Costs shot up $2.3 billion because of an unforeseen spike in construction material prices, increased land costs, and new safety federal requirements imposed after a terrible 2005 collision between freight and commuter trains in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My first day in office I was confronted with the fact we had nothing under construction, a downturn in the economy, so not enough funding, a very, very upset stakeholder group, and the task of having to take some risks to get things started,” says Philip Washington, who took the helm of RTD in early 2009. “It was not a pretty time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transit agency appeared doomed to renege again on its promises to voters. Polling showed going back to voters for more money would fail. “We sat down with Phil [Washington] on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Street Mall and said, ‘Phil, we love you, but this thing won’t pass,’” Tom Clark of the economic development corporation recalls. “Here’s what we proposed: You get every nickel you can find from the feds, do every public-private partnership you can find, and then we’ll go back with you to the public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, before the Great Recession, RTD had joined a Federal Transit Administration pilot program to explore the advantages and disadvantages of public-private partnerships, arrangements whereby private companies pay the costs of building and then operating a transit line for a fixed period in exchange for payments on the back end from the system’s public owner. In theory, such PPP arrangements could be attractive opportunities for companies, while relieving the public entity of upfront capital costs and later risks. RTD was willing to take the risk—after all, it needed a Hail Mary pass—but it had to compete with 15 other cities to win all or half of the program’s grand $1 billion demonstration grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One by one, however, the other cities fell by the wayside. Meanwhile, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, by his department’s account, was wowed by a 2010 visit to Denver with his counterparts from the Environmental Protection Agency and Housing and Urban Development. “He told me he’d been to 212 metro areas since he’d become secretary and that this was the most collaborative region in the U.S.,” Clark recalls. “The other 15 cities blew up because it’s so difficult to build infrastructure if you don’t have collaboration in your community ... We got the whole fucking billion!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was just the start. With a full-court press by Mayor Hickenlooper and Senators Mark Udall and Michael Bennet— FTA Administrator Peter Rogoff later said one of them called DOT every day— FasTracks also secured and combined grants and loans from the Federal Highway and Federal Railway Administrations, and, because of the shovel-ready character of its planned Union Station hub, stimulus disbursements. They did all this without increasing the sales tax. (The only segment that wasn’t funded was a 35-mile rail connection to Boulder and Longmont, northwest of the city. “That corridor is still the one we get thumped on the most,” RTD’s Donovan says. “But it’s the most challenging project because it will cost $1.1 to $1.4 billion to build.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction crews have been at work ever since and, if all goes according to plan, all the funded lines will be up and running by 2018, yielding a system of 77 stations and 114 miles of track in all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been some problems, most embarrassingly when the crossing gates on the new line to the airport malfunctioned, forcing RTD to post guards along the route for the launch. But officials are confident these won’t become the kinds chronic issues that now plague aging systems in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/metro-sank-into-crisis-despite-decades-of-warnings/2016/04/24/1c4db91c-0736-11e6-a12f-ea5aed7958dc_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;Washington, D.C&lt;/a&gt;. and &lt;a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/2015/12/trouble_on_the_t_boston_transit_braces_for_another_winter" target="_blank"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;. Officials are equally confident they can avert those problems decades from now because of the way they have designed RTD’s finances. There’s a standing policy that total income must remain at 1.2 times construction and operating expenses, a ratio that will provide an adequate cushion for maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now everyone is taking stock of what building Denver a system has meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As the rails spread,&lt;/b&gt; observers began to realize that RTD and the city leaders had been thinking about it all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system had been sold as a way to relieve highway congestion, and while its booming ridership figures had to be keeping some cars off the roads, experts say this was beside the point. Marilee Utter, a Denver-based vice president of the Urban Land Institute, says, “Most of the transit in the Western U.S. isn’t about mobility, because while we complain about traffic and it gets really bad in a few places sometimes, it isn’t really the justification for building six or seven corridors of rail. It’s really about economic development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transportation planners have long known that you can’t beat highway congestion by building more and bigger highways because the new capacity is promptly met by a proportional increase in driving, a phenomenon known in the field as the “fundamental law of highway congestion,” and put forward by &lt;a href="http://www.brookings.edu/experts/downsa" target="_blank"&gt;Anthony Downs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=694596" target="_blank"&gt;back in 1962&lt;/a&gt;. Five years ago, researchers at the University of Toronto looked at detailed traffic data for cities across the United States from 1983 to 2003 that &lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.6.2616" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the law and found no evidence that the presence of bus-based transit reduced congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denver’s leaders had, by accident, built something extremely valuable, but because they had misunderstood its real purpose at the outset, some potential had been squandered. “They were really asking the wrong question: How do you reduce congestion on highways?” says Wesley Marshall, a transport engineer at the University of Colorado Denver. “The obvious answer is to put transit adjacent to highways and to surround the stations with park-and-ride lots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problem is, while transit really does mitigate congestion in the long term, it does so by facilitating better, often denser land use, rather than by offering an alternative to getting from point A to point B on the interstate. Even as transit times have gone way down from Denver’s rail stations, Marshall notes, car driving times have gone up. Park and rides at inner stations have actually been shown to encourage net automotive use and associated pollution in studies by researchers at the Swiss Federal Energy Office and &lt;a href="http://www.worldtransitresearch.info/research/4801/" target="_blank"&gt;Erasmus University&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands. Marshall found this in Denver, too. Turns out people from the outer suburbs will drive past many stations until they reach a park and ride close to the city; if the park and ride wasn’t there, they’d have driven their car far less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they had asked instead: 'How do we increase accessibility, to get people from jobs to shops and activities,' they would have gotten an entirely different solution set in terms of lines and where they go,” Marshall says. Cars, instead of being at the center of each calculation, might not have been a factor at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stations themselves are the focal points, Utter says. “Transit puts a dot on the map for people to create a walkable place around, and around the country and around the word we are seeing that people want a sense of a village community, places where they can walk and where there is a mix of things to do,” she says. “When you design a transit system and identify the station areas, you’ve just identified an area of community investment. Because the most valuable real estate out there is the ‘walk to coffee’ environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only that isn’t what RTD was focused on until less than a decade ago. Long stretches of the system run down the middle of divided highways, where the right of ways were cheap. As a result, even the more successful “transit oriented developments” (T.O.D.s, among the cognoscenti) had unnecessary weaknesses. Take the area around the main station in Englewood, a suburb on the old southwest line, completed in 2000. The city built an attractive village-like neighborhood on the site of a failed mall. But because the station and the neighborhood were planned separately, RTD’s parking lots are located in such a way that commuters can bee-line from train to cars without ever setting foot in the development. “If they had people walk past the coffee shop and then to their car, these would be functional places,” Marshall sighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When he took over RTD in 2009,&lt;/b&gt; Philip Washington aimed to change all that. “I’d always thought that we transit agencies and authorities had to be more than just the T in T.O.D.,” he says. “If we have a station property, the idea is not to go into a community and just independently develop your piece of the pie. We want to work with the community on how to develop it within the fabric of their community, and to my mind that included affordable housing and walkability and nutrition in terms of stores so that it’s not a food desert.” He emphasized the creation of station area plans that sought to incorporate land owned by other public entities, or even blighted properties that could be purchased by partner agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best examples of this is the area around the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and Osage Station just south of the city center. The Denver Housing Authority wanted to replace the South Lincoln Homes, a distressed, low-slung 270-unit public housing project on 15 acres with mixed-income housing. The two key criteria critical to attracting middle- and market-rate tenants, DHA Director Ismael Guerrero says, were proximity to downtown and a light rail station, but they also wanted to ensure nobody was unwillingly displaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a close-knit community and a lot of history, where people live for generations and have family close by,” Guerrero notes. “Residents told us they wanted to make sure that we weren’t just replacing housing but improving the quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is &lt;a href="http://www.mariposadenver.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mariposa&lt;/a&gt;, a 900-unit development of energy-efficient three- to nine-story buildings with shops and office spaces mixed into a network of parks, bike paths and community gardens, some of them on land transferred by RTD to the city. Osage Caf&amp;eacute;, a breakfast and lunch place, is actually a culinary academy training local teens. &lt;a href="http://arts-street.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Arts Street&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit providing arts-oriented “learn and earn” sessions for at-risk youth, moved into the complex from temporary digs at DHA’s invitation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People wanted job training opportunities to ensure self-sufficiency, which became a guiding principle in the plans,” recalls Kimball Crangle, who was DHA’s project manager for Mariposa for many years. “A lot of times these things get dropped in the face of budget pressures, but that’s the thing about establishing guiding principles: it keeps it in the conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mariposa, now nearly complete, has retained more than 40 percent of South Lincoln Homes’ residents, Crangle notes, about four times the national average for similar projects. The net result has been diversification, not just gentrification, according to Todd Clough, executive director of the nearby &lt;a href="http://dicp.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Denver Inner City Parish&lt;/a&gt;, which helps the poor. “I was anticipating eight or 10 years ago that we would be gone by now, but because of light rail and Mariposa, we’re still relevant,” he says. “I’m a cynic; I serve poor people, that’s what I do. But, you know, this project is about as good as you can do it in a city that’s on fire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paradigm shift has also paid off in more affluent areas like suburban Arvada’s &lt;a href="http://visitarvada.org/what-to-do/historical-olde-town/" target="_blank"&gt;Olde Town&lt;/a&gt;, an old streetcar suburb with an attractive main street district. RTD’s G line will bring rail service back when it opens later this year, which has local merchants and restaurateurs anticipating a regionalization of their customer base. But town officials wanted to improve on what RTD could afford to provide at the station: a bus stop and a nine-acre surface park-and-ride lot down a steep hill from the platform. So they kicked in $30 million to build a multistory parking garage-cum-bus station, freeing the nine acres around it for apartments, stores and a hotel to be built. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re investing to enhance the station so we could provide not only a better experience for transit users, but a development that is characteristic of how Olde Town Arvada has evolved,” says city manager Mark Deven, who estimates resulting private investments in the hundreds of millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also paying off in places where there’s never been anything at all, like the area around the newly opened Pe&amp;ntilde;a Station, just shy of RTD’s airport terminus and embedded in airport owned land. “Here we had a station in the prairie and we had to figure out how to make the most of it,” says Kim Day, Denver International Airport’s CEO. Denver International owned 60 acres around the future station, but partnered with a private developer to create a 400-acre site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was hugely appealing to Jim Doyle. The president of Panasonic Eco Solutions, which was headquartered in Newark, New Jersey. Doyle was looking for a place to move his division, which deploys large solar panels and battery storage systems. “We had this fast growing division that’s very people and engineer intensive and uses a lot of land, so we needed to be in the Midwest,” he says. By August 2014 he had narrowed his search from 22 cities to two: Denver and Dallas. Dallas offered tax incentives. But Panasonic’s top brass in Japan had been looking for somewhere to create a North American version of the company’s &lt;a href="http://panasonic.net/es/solution-works/fujisawa/" target="_blank"&gt;Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town&lt;/a&gt;, 30 miles outside Tokyo, where solar-panel topped buildings, infrastructure and even household appliances are managed by Big Data and the Internet of Things. Denver’s rail-centered greenfield site, right next to an airport with nonstop service to Tokyo looked perfect. “We came out to Denver and the mayor, the governor and the senators all said, ‘Yeah, let’s do something here, let’s do something that’s a real showcase, that people will actually fly into Denver to see,’” Doyle recalls. “That just tipped the scales.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panasonic Eco Solutions headquarters opens next to Pe&amp;ntilde;a Station later this summer. Ultimately, a master-planned, &lt;a href="http://www.fulenwider.com/Properties/Pena-Station.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;high-tech neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; of hotels, businesses, homes and corporate offices is supposed to spring up around it. Cameras and sensors will tell drivers where the nearest open parking spot is, or inform the snowplow when it needs to clear a street. “If there was no train station, there would be no value to this place,” Doyle notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the airport itself, Day has been looking to Amsterdam and Frankfurt for examples of transit developments at airports. “There are so many businesses today that want to sit on or near an airport because we are essentially so global,” she says. “It’s the train that lets us attract them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas is starting to feel a lot farther away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Marijuana Industry’s War on the Poor</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/what-works-colorado-denver-marijuana-pot-industry-legalization-neighborhoods-dispensaries-negative-213906</link>
      <description>Denver’s booming pot industry may be trendy, but it’s giving poorer neighborhoods a headache.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Take a stroll past the gray stucco-clad building in northeast Denver and it’s not hard to figure out what’s going on behind the bright green doors.  On a recent afternoon, outside Green Fields Cannabis Co., a sweetly pungent, slightly skunky odor filled the air before a light rain began to rinse it away. Just a block south on Brighton Boulevard, past a salvage yard and a Mexican grocery, the smell of what’s growing inside Starbuds is sometimes noticeable before you arrive in front of the medical and recreational marijuana chain’s original location. Even drivers whizzing by on Interstate 70 catch a heady whiff of Denver’s hottest new product as they zip across town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they don’t have to live here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In working-class neighborhoods like Elyria-Swansea, Globeville and Northeast Park Hill there’s a growing sense among residents that they have been overrun by a new drug trade, legal but noxious all the same. These communities once offered plentiful jobs in the city’s smelters, meatpacking houses, brickyards and stockyards, but those industries are mostly gone now, along with Denver's cow town image. In the past few years, the city's newest growth industry has moved in—and not in a subtle way. In Elyria-Swansea alone, more than three dozen businesses are licensed to grow and sell marijuana and another dozen companies manufacture edible pot products. To the people living in the modest homes near the grow operations that supply the dispensaries and shops in better-off parts of town, the smell is not only an inconvenience but a reminder of their lack of political clout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things that we thought was going to happen when [recreational] marijuana was legalized was that drugs would be taken out of our community,” said Candi CdeBaca, an education and community activist whose longtime family home is steps from a commercial grow operation in Elyria-Swansea. “What happened was that the drugs stayed—and the drug dealers changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years after legal sales of recreational marijuana began in Colorado, the biggest fears that once preoccupied Denver city officials—higher crime, more drug use among teens and a drag on tourism—have not come to pass. Instead, the expanded industry, with 21-and-over recreational sales joining a longer-sanctioned medical marijuana trade, has pumped millions of dollars into government coffers. It's swathed the city in a trendy glow that likely attracts as many outsiders as it repels. But in lower-income neighborhoods of Denver, the explosion of smelly commercial cultivation operations, which crank out tons of high-priced weed for sometimes-chic, sometimes-earthy dispensaries in more fashionable parts of town, has rekindled long-standing grievances about being ignored by City Hall. And residents are beginning to demand big changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, they identified a point of leverage they hoped would help them extract meaningful concessions from city officials. When temporary restrictions limiting entry to the city's recreational marijuana market came up for review, CdeBaca was among an army of residents who pushed back loudly against granting new licenses to the numerous pot entrepreneurs who were  lining up to jump into the market. They were asking for relief—and even a rollback—from what they see as oversaturation near residences and schools. &lt;a href="http://extras.denverpost.com/maps/news/marijuana/licensed-facilities/" target="_blank"&gt;Citywide&lt;/a&gt;, 210 stores sell medical or recreational marijuana (or both), including 63 that grow marijuana on site. Another 211 standalone grow operations are clustered in mostly poorer and heavily minority sections of the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado, whose voters legalized recreational marijuana sales in the 2012 election, now has one of the most thriving legal marijuana industries in the world. Sellers of both medical and recreational marijuana reported just shy of $1 billion in sales statewide last year, up 42 percent over their haul during 2014's recreational rollout. Denver businesses hold nearly half of state licenses, generating $29 million last year in marijuana sales tax and licensing proceeds for the city, including $7.7 million from a special 3.5 percent sales tax on recreational marijuana. The state capital has become, in the eyes of legalization advocates, a testing ground for innovation and smart regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s created what I consider to be the most robust economy in the country in terms of product, in terms of thought leaders, in terms of regulatory design,” said Christian Sederberg, an attorney who helped campaign for 2012’s Amendment 64. “We are so much further developed than any of the other states.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the neighborhood activists' outcry has forced a reckoning that jolted city officials, industry representatives and business owners, resulting in a wave of new restrictions that were borne out of a fierce debate—and left both neighborhood advocates and some industry players dissatisfied. A new local law, approved last month by the City Council, aims to limit industry growth by capping the number of locations of stores and grow operations, parceling out any licenses that become available via an annual lottery. The city also will stop licensing new medical grow facilities and dispensaries, which have continued to thrive in the recreational age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Michael Hancock views the neighborhood outcry as unsurprising. City rules required grow operations—which favor warehouse-like structures—to locate in industrial-zoned areas. &amp;quot;Certainly, nobody wants to live under the clouds of those odors everyday,&amp;quot; Hancock said, adding that it’s incumbent on the marijuana industry to work with communities to reduce the negative effects of their operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, Hancock signed off on an ordinance change that will require businesses seeking new licenses or renewals to submit &amp;quot;good neighbor&amp;quot; outreach plans. And next year, grow operations, which take widely varying approaches to reduce the smells they emit, will have to present odor-control plans to the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some City Council members had pressed for more severe restrictions on the industry's size. As it stands, the number of grow operations will be ratcheted back slightly in coming years as some go out of business. And future grow operations can't open within 1,000 feet of a residential zone—a rule, it's worth noting, that would have prevented the opening of roughly 60 percent of existing grow operations had it been in place from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But among neighborhood activists, the new ordinances are greeted with skepticism or outright dismissal, in part because the new industry caps allow in the near term for the opening of more than three dozen new stores and grows that already were awaiting license decisions, including a couple in Elyria-Swansea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They screwed it up when they rolled out the recreational marijuana rules and now they're trying to correct it,&amp;quot; said Drew Dutcher, an architect and activist who lives two blocks from the Starbuds pot shop. &amp;quot;It's too little, too late.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For years, city and state leaders&lt;/b&gt; have navigated without a playbook. Indeed, in many ways they have written the playbook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ragtag local medical marijuana market had developed largely unfettered since Colorado voters passed a constitutional amendment legalizing pot for medicinal purposes in 2000. But the city began licensing businesses in 2009 to rein in the industry, and the state quickly followed suit, creating Colorado's dual licensing scheme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These laws allowed for commercial cultivation operations, brought about rules such as keeping new storefronts 1,000 feet from schools and day care centers, and instituted heavy state oversight, including barcode tags on each marijuana plant and surveillance cameras inside each grow facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That level of oversight gave Colorado voters confidence when they approved the recreational marijuana amendment in 2012, despite opposition from prominent elected officials, including Hancock and Governor John Hickenlooper. The then-new mayor worried publicly about detrimental social and economic effects should Denver became nationally synonymous with pot. City voters approved Amendment 64 with 66 percent support—11 percentage points higher than statewide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hancock and City Council members took that margin as a mandate, even as most of the city's suburban neighbors have decided against allowing recreational sales. For the first two years after sales began in January 2014, the city allowed only medical marijuana licensees who were in good standing as of late 2013 to jump into the recreational market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the rollout was rapid. Two months into 2014, the city and the state had licensed 47 recreational shops in Denver, according to the city's alt-weekly, &lt;i&gt;Westword&lt;/i&gt;. By April 2014, the total was 65. The growth continued, and as of the start of this year, city figures showed 143 Denver shops were licensed for recreational sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states have watched the Colorado experience with apprehension. In Washington state, which began allowing legal recreational marijuana sales in mid-2014, state leaders opted for a slower, state-controlled rollout. That was in large part because that state's unruly medical-marijuana market was largely unregulated. Even now, Seattle has just a few dozen recreational stores within its boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Washington was interested in having a more structured and cautious approach,&amp;quot; said Sam M&amp;eacute;ndez, executive director of the Cannabis Law &amp;amp; Policy Project at the University of Washington School of Law. Within his office, some consider Colorado—and Denver—a cautionary tale most places would be foolish to follow. &amp;quot;I don't think this industry should move too quickly,&amp;quot; M&amp;eacute;ndez said. &amp;quot;If you do, there's potential for backlash, and this whole grand experiment could fail.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Denver, city officials are more confident in their track record, though still sensitive about the extent to which legal marijuana molds outsiders' perceptions of the city. &amp;quot;In terms of the things we were all concerned about—in terms of increased crime and increased use among our young people—we have not seen those things materialize,&amp;quot; Hancock said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;That confidence in Denver's regulatory efforts&lt;/b&gt; isn't shared in areas that feel overrun by marijuana. Elyria-Swansea was among a few neighborhoods identified by the &lt;i&gt;Denver Post&lt;/i&gt; early this year as having roughly one marijuana business for every 91 residents—a clustering that intensifies problems like smell, but that also claims precious real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have people who have tried to start businesses, and they weren't able to lease the spaces because the marijuana industry came in and could make a higher offer—and do it instantly,&amp;quot; said CdeBaca, the neighborhood activist, at a news conference by activists in April. &amp;quot;We've borne the burden of the state and city's growth at the cost of our residents.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weed explosion, paradoxically, happened just as the city had begun paying more attention to improving the downtrodden neighborhood. An upcoming $1.1 billion city-led project aims to transform the grounds that host the annual National Western Stock Show and Rodeo into a year-round event, education and agricultural innovation center. In two years, a commuter rail line will connect the neighborhood to downtown. &amp;quot;We went through a neighborhood plan that has all these great visions of nice neighborhoods,&amp;quot; said Dutcher, the architect who lives two blocks from a marijuana shop. But he fears the marijuana influence will undercut any improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there's that smell—only the latest industrial byproduct to cloud the neighborhood over the decades. On a clear day, the odor jockeys for attention with the odor from a nearby pet food plant. &amp;quot;When you can't smell Purina, it's the 'headache' marijuana smell that gets you more than anything,&amp;quot; said Albus Brooks, the city councilman who represents Elyria-Swansea and neighboring Globeville, during a tour of the biggest offenders in both areas. Until recently, Brooks' own home in another nearby neighborhood was about 800 feet from a grow operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channeling his district's frustrations, he joined the minority in the council's 7-5 vote last month on the new industry location caps, arguing they didn't go nearly far enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meg Sanders is among business owners who say the industry has a responsibility to step up. She is the CEO of a company called Mindful, which has a grow facility in northeast Denver and a store selling medical and recreational product on the city's resurgent East Colfax Avenue. It has three other stores across Colorado, two more on the way and a dispensary soon to open in Illinois. Mindful holds job fairs at a nearby recreation center, and several times a year, its employees hand out vegetables grown on a 3,000-square-foot plot outside its grow facility. It's also testing new odor-suppression technology. She says she wants her businesses to help build communities, not detract from them. She was among industry representatives who suggested the new city requirement that marijuana licensees submit community engagement or &amp;quot;good neighbor&amp;quot; plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Sanders, a believer in the good that marijuana can do for those who are suffering, still resists the idea that the city should restrain the industry's growth. &amp;quot;We don't limit Walgreens going up on every other corner or other pharmacies,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;So why would we here?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>How the Bathroom Wars Shaped America</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-bathroom-bills-politics-north-carolina-lgbt-transgender-history-restrooms-era-civil-rights-213902</link>
      <description>It’s not just North Carolina. Some of America’s great political struggles have pivoted around who uses which toilet.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no more controversial place in American life right now than the public restroom. It’s become the latest battlefield in the culture wars — an issue so electric that the most powerful politicians in the country have weighed in: President Barack Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, at least 15 states have considered “bathroom bills” similar to the legislation recently enacted in North Carolina, which blocks transgender people from using bathrooms that don’t correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificates. Opponents of these proposals have argued that the real impetus isn’t restroom protocol; it’s part of an ugly attempt by social conservatives to score a victory against a surging &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/alliance-defending-freedom-lobbies-anti-lgbt-bathroom-bills" target="_blank"&gt;LGBT movement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it would be a mistake to see the bathroom bills as nothing more than a desperate last-minute counterpunch against an ascendant gay-rights movement. There’s a forgotten history at play: For as long as public restrooms have existed, they’ve been a political flash point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For generations, Americans have imparted bathrooms with their deepest anxieties about changing social norms and practices. From the Industrial Revolution to Jim Crow to women’s lib to today, restrooms have been a proxy for political fights on almost every major issue in American life — race, class, gender, crime, sexuality, you name it. Much like our current foray, past bathroom brawls drew the involvement of the marquee figures of those eras — President &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PFnVAwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PA2592&amp;amp;ots=MKw-C1szqn&amp;amp;dq=reagan%20%22equal%20rights%20amendment%22%20restrooms&amp;amp;pg=PA2592#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt;, Governor &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CBgSAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;q=reagan+%22restrooms,+barracks,+and+shower+rooms%22&amp;amp;dq=reagan+%22restrooms,+barracks,+and+shower+rooms%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqjruv4OLMAhVCKCYKHQJbAw8Q6wEILzAB" target="_blank"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, President &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=qo9r4_rnrasC&amp;amp;lpg=PA22&amp;amp;dq=johnson%20segregated%20restrooms&amp;amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank"&gt;Lyndon Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and Phyllis Schlafly, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the past is any guide, we shouldn’t count on the current struggle over restrooms for transgender people being easy or quick. In fact, bathrooms have proven a surprisingly powerful political lever over the years. They’ve been pivotal in many political arguments — and, in perhaps the most masterful harnessing of bathroom anxiety in American history, a largely invented controversy over unisex bathrooms in the 1970s ultimately killed off the almost-enacted Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;* * *&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For more than 100 years&lt;/b&gt;, Americans have projected their most profound fears about social change onto public restrooms. And just as we’ve seen in the 2016 campaign — with Ted Cruz &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/723487122267594755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank"&gt;running an ad&lt;/a&gt; that asks “Should a grown man pretending to be a woman be allowed to use … the same restroom used by your daughter? Your wife?” — women’s restrooms especially have borne the brunt of these fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As public restrooms emerged in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, American men and women both viewed ladies’ rooms as a public extension of the home — a safe spot where women could escape the outside world and its dangers. As the number of women working in factories and mills increased, so too did cultural anxieties about ladies leaving the protection and privacy of the domestic sphere. Governments started making bathrooms their business, enacting laws requiring sex-segregated public restrooms, beginning with Massachusetts in 1887. By 1920, 43 other states had put similar laws on the books. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the decades that followed, changes in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century middle-class American home similarly shaped attitudes and laws regarding public restrooms. Following World War II, suburbia blossomed and white middle-class American families moved into new homes that exhibited luxuries previously available to only the upper class — including multiple restrooms. Now, middle-class parents could enjoy master bathrooms, with separate, more modest accommodations for their children. In some homes, parents even assigned their sons and daughters different bathrooms to avoid any improper moments between their children. These changes strengthened the idea that the bathroom should be a zone of personal privacy, but also endowed bathrooms — even in anodyne suburban homes — with a latent sexual charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such attitudes &lt;a href="http://notchesblog.com/2015/11/09/stalling-civil-rights/" target="_blank"&gt;helped shape white resistance to desegregation&lt;/a&gt; of public spaces, restrooms included, during the civil rights movement. In the Jim Crow South, white racism branded black men as sexual predators imperiling the virtue of white women. With black women seen as their accomplices, integrated restrooms posed a threat: unclean and oversexualized black men would, by proxy, have access to white women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/195/677/1524436/" target="_blank"&gt;1961’s &lt;i&gt;Turner v. Randolph&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; case, the City of Memphis, Tennessee, employed this exact rationale in opposing the desegregation of restrooms in its public library. “The public welfare” was at stake, the City argued, because venereal diseases were commonplace among blacks, and an integrated ladies’ room would put white women at risk of catching VD from black women. During this era, segregationist literature across the South told parents to keep their daughters home from integrated schools lest they catch VD from young black women now using the school restrooms. In Mississippi, one white second-grade teacher worried that if her school integrated, her white students &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5ggbBwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PT85&amp;amp;lpg=PT85&amp;amp;dq=segregationists+warned+about+venereal+diseases&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=L1lKyrlvhk&amp;amp;sig=WjZcYTaNqPkZO0XUDOXp-QpCwNo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxmqHwmOPMAhUU5WMKHZHVD-8Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22contract%20syphilis%22&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank"&gt;would “contract syphilis” from toilet seats&lt;/a&gt; used by black children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, public fears about a “homosexual menace” overtaking the nation stoked alarm that young boys faced sexual danger in public restrooms. A police crackdown on same-sex sexual activity in men’s restrooms in the 1950s and 1960s — this at the time when many Americans equated homosexuality with pedophilia — deepened these worries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public officials distributed pamphlets warning about “child attackers” who hid out in public restrooms to capture their prey.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“Never wait or play around toilets. Always leave immediately,” a popular 1954 pamphlet used across the nation instructed. The 1961 public service film, “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECilAeLLATc" target="_blank"&gt;Boys Beware&lt;/a&gt;,” broadcasted those ideas to an even larger audience. “Public restrooms can often be a hangout for the homosexual,” a narrator ominously explained. “Bobby and his friends hadn’t noticed the man who had been in the restroom when they changed.” Bobby and his friends had erred in treating their restroom as a safe space — the very mistake predators relied on to carry out their crimes. School children understood the message: Boys had to be on guard when they entered public restrooms, vigilant against the violent, sexual dangers that lurked there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;While the homophobic “lavender scare”&lt;/b&gt; had subsided by the 1970s, conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly drew on both its legacy and on the white backlash to the civil rights movement to mount a brilliant attack on the Equal Rights Amendment. A proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing sex equality under the law, the ERA had been passed by Congress in 1972 and sent to the states for ratification. By 1974, 33 states had passed the ERA, just five short of the number needed for full ratification. Though the odds of stopping the amendment looked poor, Schlafly quickly organized a national movement to block the ERA’s adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schlafly’s main objection to the amendment concerned its second clause, which she worried would give the federal government unrestricted power. She quickly realized that this technocratic argument inspired little passion among her foot soldiers. Instead, they wanted her to focus on how the amendment would change their lives and their families. Schlafly contended that if passed, the ERA would destroy the traditional family — and thus society itself — by eradicating sexual difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The argument depended on fanciful leaps of logic, but after the tumult of the civil rights movement and the sexual revolution, her audience was primed to imagine the worst. In Schlafly’s telling, the consequences of an ERA  would know no end. While feminists argued that the ERA would provide women with equal protections in areas like employment and education, Schlafly warned the amendment’s effects would extend into that rare sanctuary of privacy and safety that women had outside the home: the ladies’ room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once gender equality had been guaranteed under the Constitution, Schlafly cautioned, no laws could prevent men from entering women’s bathrooms. Public restrooms could become a dangerous trap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ERA advocates called her bathroom talk ridiculous. “There's been a lot of distortions about the Equal Rights Amendment,” &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PFnVAwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PA2592&amp;amp;dq=reagan%20%22equal%20rights%20amendment%22%20restrooms&amp;amp;pg=PA2592#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=restroom&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank"&gt;said President Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt;. “It doesn't say anything about bathrooms.” But Schlafly’s attack was shrewd, pulling together the different strands of bathroom panics that had excited Americans for decades. Slyly drawing on the loaded language of the prior decade, Schlafly and her allies warned that ERA would “&lt;a href="http://www.cristanwilliams.com/b/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1977.png" target="_blank"&gt;integrate public toilets&lt;/a&gt;.” Since most Southern states had yet to vote on the ERA, language that suggested it would follow the recent racial integration of public restrooms with sex integration ensured a spirited Southern opposition to the amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapping into the oldest concerns about women’s public restrooms, a pamphlet from Schlafly’s powerful STOP ERA organization claimed that women would lose their “right to privacy based on sex” in “public restrooms and other public facilities.” The ERA, &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CBgSAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;q=reagan+%22restrooms,+barracks,+and+shower+rooms%22&amp;amp;dq=reagan+%22restrooms,+barracks,+and+shower+rooms%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqjruv4OLMAhVCKCYKHQJbAw8Q6wEILzAB" target="_blank"&gt;said former Governor Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, could “degrade and defeminize women by forcing them to mingle with men in close, intimate quarters.” As it always had, the notion of privacy carried deeper meanings of safety and protection, which Schlafly now warned would be eliminated. The ERA, its opponents charged, would grant men, including rapists and pedophiles, equal access to women’s restrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In describing rapists and pedophiles hiding out in public restrooms ready to attack unsuspecting women and girls, Schlafly summoned the fear of homosexual predators stalking boys’ restrooms, and refashioned it for a new crisis. Convinced that perverts had long made use of men’s restrooms, ERA’s opponents easily suggested that a new crop of deviants would exploit the law. &lt;a href="http://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1209&amp;amp;context=honors_theses#page=36" target="_blank"&gt;Anti-ERA cartoons showed&lt;/a&gt; rapists freely entering restrooms where a “Persons” sign had replaced the one for “Ladies.” Conservative women besieged their state legislators with letters demanding they vote against the “Common Toilet Law,” the new name they had given the ERA. Some protesters donned costumes, dressing as outhouses adorned with “Theirs” signs, — an effigy of the unisex restrooms they believed the ERA would require.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers responded, many explaining they were voting against the ERA to ensure their wives and daughters would never face a sexual predator in their public restrooms, ensuring the amendment’s defeat.&lt;b&gt; “&lt;/b&gt;I’ve had enough civil rights to choke a hungry goat,” &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9fCeV1Tel-oC&amp;amp;pg=PA113&amp;amp;dq=%22I+want+the+right+to+segregate+my+family+from+these+misfits+and+perverts%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG8eXAi-PMAhVGKWMKHawaAc4Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22I%20want%20the%20right%20to%20segregat" target="_blank"&gt;bellowed Clay Smothers&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas state legislator speaking at an anti-ERA rally in 1977. “I ask for victory over the perverts of this country. I want the right to segregate my family from these misfits and perverts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;* * *&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Today, that same logic&lt;/b&gt; is behind North Carolina’s bathroom bill and similar measures being pushed throughout the country. Drawing from Schlafly’s playbook, conservative activists have reframed these civil rights matters as public safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In advance of Houston’s rejection of an anti-discrimination ordinance in November 2015, one political ad blanketing TV airwaves repeated the image Schlafly had developed 40 years before, showing a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7thOvSvC4E" target="_blank"&gt;sketchy man trapping a young girl in a bathroom stall&lt;/a&gt;. “It was about protecting our grandmoms and our mothers and our wives and our sisters and our daughters,” &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/us/houston-voters-repeal-anti-bias-measure.html" target="_blank"&gt;Texas’ Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said&lt;/a&gt; after the Houston referendum passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has echoed that sentiment. This February, he &lt;a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article61307857.html" target="_blank"&gt;warned members of the Charlotte City Council&lt;/a&gt; that passing a nondiscrimination ordinance guaranteeing legal protections for LGBT people could “create major public safety issues by putting citizens in possible danger from deviant actions by individuals taking improper advantage of a bad policy.” A few weeks later, McCrory signed HB-2, the “bathroom bill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, politicians and activists have met cultural unease over restrooms with campaigns and laws aimed at regulating and protecting those spaces. Just as frequently, those acts have depended on curtailing civil rights. The cruelest irony of it all may be that the language of protection and safety — tossed about so freely in these debates — is often used to ensure the very loss of those things for the people who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>On the Lonely Island of ‘Never Trump’</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/never-trump-hillary-clinton-foreign-policy-establishment-213898</link>
      <description>Across Washington, stalwarts of the GOP foreign-policy establishment find themselves suddenly adrift. Could they really vote for—gulp—Hillary?</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“My wife said, ‘never,’” said Brian Hook, looking pained and slicing the air with a long, pale hand. He stood, tall and sandy-haired, pink tie perfectly knotted, in the cavernous foyer of the Mellon Auditorium, which, that day was hosting the Peterson Institute’s Fiscal Summit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Never” isn’t a word one expects to hear from a Republican lifer contemplating a possible job in a possible Republican administration. Hook has a long, distinguished conservative r&amp;eacute;sum&amp;eacute;. He was a foreign policy adviser to the Romney and Pawlenty campaigns; a special assistant to President George W. Bush, whom he also served as an assistant secretary of state and as a senior adviser to the United Nations ambassador. In any normal year, he’d be in line for a plum post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not this time. It was a rainy afternoon outside, one in a long chain of rainy afternoons, as if it hadn’t stopped raining since Donald Trump clinched the GOP nomination in Indiana. And Hook is one of a small, die-hard set of the Republicans who have been wandering outside this season, getting wet, locked out of their own house. &amp;quot;Even if you say you support him as the nominee,” Hook says, “you go down the list of his positions and you see you disagree on every one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s path to the Republican nomination has been littered with discarded conservative principles, and in its wake has left a party establishment bewildered by the realization that precious few Republican voters seem to care about those principles. As Trump completes his hostile takeover of the party, the GOP political class has been scrambling to find ways to coexist with a standard-bearer whom it reviles. Last week, Trump met with Speaker Paul Ryan and various other Republican leaders on the Hill, all of whom were managing, in one way or another, to cozy up to the presumptive candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for one group of Republicans, “never” has become the operative word. This is the party’s foreign policy establishment, a close-knit set of thinkers, diplomats and strategists with an internationalist ideology deeply rooted in a belief that America has a leading role to play in a changing and dangerous world. For them, Trump’s Lindbergh-style isolationism and defiant ignorance of the world’s complexities is simply too horrifying to support. They have emerged as the vanguard of the #nevertrump holdout movement—and, as their party leaves them to embrace the front-runner, they’re increasingly a cohort in search of a home. Will it be four more years of working in think tanks? Could the answer be Hillary Clinton?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, when the rest of their party was still treating Trump as a temporary nuisance, prominent Republicans in foreign policy—Robert Gates, Michael Hayden, former Bush National Security Council member Peter Feaver—began &lt;a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/26/trump-foreign-policy-republican/" target="_blank"&gt;sounding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-kind-of-president-we-need/2015/12/03/a4bd5e68-979e-11e5-94f0-9eeaff906ef3_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/hayden--i-am-troubled-by-trump-statements-550067779673" target="_blank"&gt;alarm&lt;/a&gt; over a candidate whose lack of knowledge about the world beyond America’s borders was exceeded only by his dangerous ideas about it. Trump didn’t know what a nuclear triad was; he wanted to pull out of NATO. He suggested that South Korea and Japan should develop their own nuclear weapons, casually brushing aside the generational bipartisan achievement on nonproliferation. He wanted to ban all Muslims from coming to the United States; he advocated killing the families of terrorists, in direct violation of international law. (He has since backed off that idea.) He &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/will-trump-flunk-the-commander-in-chief-test-218093" target="_blank"&gt;rebuffed&lt;/a&gt; attempts by Republican foreign policy think experts who offered their expertise. Why would he need them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, 121 of these Republican foreign policy specialists banded together and published &lt;a href="http://warontherocks.com/2016/03/open-letter-on-donald-trump-from-gop-national-security-leaders/" target="_blank"&gt;an open letter&lt;/a&gt; opposing Trump, saying he would “make America less safe.” The move was intended to register their alarm and land a solid, even fatal blow by saying he’d lost the faith of a constituency whose support he’d need to govern. But it didn’t stop him. When he rolled out his foreign policy vision the following month, it was under Charles Lindbergh’s “America First” banner. He extolled America’s allies—but it was the Russian ambassador who sat front row, center. The ambassadors of Britain, France, Germany were nowhere to be seen. The Republican hawks were horrified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never. Republican foreign policy wonks could never, would never work with such an administration. (And even if they wanted to, a wife might veto it.) But now they’re left with a question: Where can they go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;*** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first and most electric question&lt;/b&gt; is whether to rally behind Hillary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As horrifying as it might sound to support a Democrat, it’s not quite the extreme position in the foreign policy world as it is elsewhere. Since World War II and until the Iraq War splintered it, American foreign policy was largely a matter of bipartisan consensus. The people who signed the March letter cover a broad swath of Washington’s foreign policy thinkers and practitioners, ranging from the superideological neocon hawks that brought us the Iraq misadventure, to moderate centrists who nonetheless believe in a muscular American foreign policy. For various reasons, they have found a home under the Republican umbrella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What unites them now is Trump: He shares their party affiliation and nothing else. He is dismissive of painstakingly earned knowledge and time-honored policies in a way they find insulting and terrifying. His foreign policy—to the extent one can be sussed out from his numerous mutually contradictory theses—is one that would have America pull back from pretty much everywhere, letting Russia, China and various other forces fill the resulting vacuum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with the prospect of having this boor in possession of the nuclear codes, many of these Republicans are doing the unthinkable. Some have openly come out for Clinton: Robert Kagan, Tom Nichols, Max Boot all  say they’re voting for the former secretary of state. Their very public declarations echo the movement up and down the ranks of Republican foreign policy specialists throwing in for  Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that for those of us who think first and foremost about foreign policy, there’s no competition,” says Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA operative in the Middle East who is now a fellow at the uber-hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “We know what Hillary Clinton more or less is, and that is easily better than what Donald Trump is.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One finds many more Republican Hillary voters as soon as anonymity is granted. “I’m voting for Hillary,” one Republican foreign policy wonk told me the day after Trump’s Indiana win. “I think it’s a no-brainer.” For Republicans who vote primarily on foreign policy and who favor U.S. involvement in the world, Clinton is not just the lesser evil, but the best option. She is a traditional, bona fide internationalist and hawk, and, on foreign policy, she is to the right of both Obama and Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not even a fucking close call,” said a senior GOP congressional staffer who works on foreign policy. “I’m struck by people who are like, ‘This is a dilemma!’ What’s the dilemma? I’m not here to tell you I love everything about Hillary Clinton, and that she’s going to be perfect, but from the point of view of someone who thinks about foreign policy and national security, it’s not even a close call.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be a recruiting bonanza for Clinton, but Democratic foreign policy wonks are scratching their heads, trying to figure out what to do with their stranded Republican colleagues. “Everyone is thinking about exactly this question,” says the left-leaning wonk. “Your Republican friends are moaning and weeping. Democrats are calling each other up, saying, this is a huge resource, what can we do, we’re still in a primary, don’t talk to the campaign about it, find a way to do it outside the campaign, how do Democrats not get sucked into Republicans’ internecine warfare?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic foreign policy listservs are abuzz. “Past several days I've had about a half-dozen former Rubio, then Cruz campaign types reach out to me asking about ways they might help defeat Trump,” wrote one Democrat on a Democratic foreign policy listserv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finding ways for our disaffected and motivated GOP peers to coordinate with Democrats to help defeat Trump strikes me as something this group could potentially help with,” wrote another. “We could perhaps build some loose networks, hold a couple of dinners etc., and maybe try co-authoring some op-eds etc.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I’ve been working over A LOT of Rs,” wrote one more. “They’re apoplectic, obviously, and yet not a single one says they’ll check the HRC box. The question for us to whiteboard is what more they can do short of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One despondent former John McCain adviser told me that a few of his friends from across the aisle, outside foreign policy advisers to the Clinton campaign, have reached out, albeit vaguely. “What now, wise guy?” the adviser says of their tone of their emails. “If you’re interested in coming our way, the water’s fine.” He laughs. “I don’t know whether to interpret it as a sign of interest or sympathy, or some of both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Clinton campaign itself has yet to reach out or to develop a plan for what to do with the defecting hawks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we're seeing right now is a groundswell of serious national security experts across the entire political spectrum standing up and arguing that Donald Trump can't be our next commander in chief because he's too reckless; he's too erratic; the risk is too great,” Jake Sullivan, Clinton’s longtime foreign policy adviser, said in a statement to POLITICO. “There are Americans of all persuasions who may not agree with every position Hillary Clinton espouses, but who place a premium on our national security. They know that we face complex challenges in a dangerous world, and that we need to elect a president who will bring clear-eyed, strong leadership to the White House.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privately, some outside advisers to the Clinton campaign are far less generous—and say there’s a good reason for the campaign not to go after them officially. “They’re toxic,” said one such adviser. “They’re a strain of conservative thinkers that are military expansionists and that’s not where Hillary Clinton is, it’s not where the party is. Democrats post-Iraq are deeply anxious about military intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if these anti-Trump foreign policy conservatives could ever play any role in the Clinton campaign or a Clinton administration, the adviser guffawed. “Who is saying, ‘You know what we need to do is pick up the people who got us into the Iraq War! I mean, they’re geniuses!’ They’ve been wrong about everything!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-center"&gt;*** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After the shock of Trump winning Indiana,&lt;/b&gt; the Bush family and Mitt Romney dug in against him, and it looked like the foreign policy Republicans might become the first settlers of a new Republican land, a conservative city upon a hill. And a few prominent Republicans, like Mark Salter and Erick Erickson, did join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But increasingly, the party mainstream is warming to Trump, and the terrain inhabited by the Republican foreign policy establishment is looking less like a land, and more like an iceberg that has broken off a groaning glacier, and is now floating through the seas of Washington, adrift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t figured that out, I honestly don’t know,” said the former McCain adviser when I asked him what the future held for him. He had worked on one of the 2016 Republican primary campaigns but wasn’t sure what to do now. “You’re asking a very existential question,” he said. “If you got any good ideas, let me know.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, I asked, if Trump wins the presidency, and then appoints someone mainstream and palatable as his secretary of state? Say a Richard Haass or a Jon Hunstman? Might there be an acceptable job under a Secretary Huntsman?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a pause at the other end of the line. Many of the neocons I spoke to said they could understand the desire to serve the country and at least mitigate the damage that a President Trump would do, and some even said they could take up that cross. “He may do it anyway and then he’ll have done it without us,” says one former senior Bush staffer. “That’ll be a big concern. Maybe we can influence him, and he can be a better president.” The staffer added, “I wouldn’t take a White House job, but if there’s something useful I could do, where you feel like you’re working for the taxpayer and not the Trump court, I’d do it.” Others balk at what they see as naked careerism, seeing this is as one of those rare moments in life when one takes a bold and moral stance. It would be in bad, bad taste, Republicans say. One would be leaving all morals at the door. “People will remember that,” says Hook. The left-leaning foreign policy expert told me of the intense “existential conversations” with Republican colleagues. “The level of anxiety over the choice and what the choice is—this is a moral choice,” says the expert. “It’s much stronger claim on that than I’ve heard before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what did this hawk, the former McCain adviser, think? Could he do it? “OK, well, what are you really going to be doing? Is it going it be implementing the ban on Muslims? Is it the Kill Civilians Plan?” he asked. “Or do you work on something narrow, like Bhutan? It’s not a deal that I would take. It’s not a lot of fun to work on a narrow issue where you work for an administration that you don’t agree with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Hook and Gerecht and pretty much everyone who signed the open letter, he too was looking at another four, maybe eight years on think tank row, and worried that if he ever saw the inside of an administration again, he’d be out of shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s true either way, if either Clinton or Trump wins,” he said. “After Reagan and Bush, when Democrats spent 12 years in the wilderness, they came in rusty because they hadn’t had experience. They left government when they were in their mid-30s and came back in their 50s. They left office at the height of the Cold War, then came back and there’s no Soviet Union.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s still months to go till the elections, for the shock to pass, and for the Clinton campaign to figure out what to do with the hawkish drifters. “They’ll probably do what they need to defeat Trump,” posits Steve McMahon, a Democratic consultant who works at the bipartisan firm Purple Strategies. “If they need them to slide things under the door, they’ll slide things under the door. If they need them to be quiet, they’ll be quiet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, though, the little bit of Republican iceberg floats on, unmoored. The McCain adviser, for one, is comforted by the body heat on the little chunk of ice: All his colleagues who had been dispersed across the various now-failed Republican primary campaigns are done competing with each other. All are equally marooned, equally stumped at their futures. “In a small but a significant silver lining, I admire all the people who put their principle before their careerism,” he told me. “It’s very meaningful.” As for their small chip off the iceberg, well, he doesn’t know where it’ll drift to next. “So the question is, does the iceberg melt because of global warming or are we Inuits who have been put out on the iceberg to not eat the resources of the camp?” he asked and laughed. “I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>How the NRA Keeps Killer Guns on the Market</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/nra-guns-sales-control-zimmerman-police-213895</link>
      <description>Many were outraged when Zimmerman auctioned the gun that killed Trayvon Martin. But these macabre sales happen all the time.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Kel-Tec PF-9 pistol, which retails for about $300, is one of the cheapest American-made guns available on the civilian market. In used condition, these are junk guns, Saturday night specials. But last week, George Zimmerman listed his in an online auction with a starting bid of $5,000. This was the gun he used in 2012 to shoot and kill Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These macabre sales actually happen all the time in the United States. Most of the 116,000 Americans who are shot each year (32,000 fatally) receive barely a mention in local news—the perpetrators aren’t notorious, and their guns don’t become collector’s items. But neither are they removed from the market. In fact, thousands of Americans buy used guns every year—legally—with no idea those weapons were used to take someone’s life. A recent spate of laws, supported by the National Rifle Association, aims to keep it that way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past eight years, according to a CNN analysis, &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/21/news/police-selling-seized-guns/" target="_blank"&gt;11 states&lt;/a&gt; have passed NRA-backed laws encouraging or requiring police to resell confiscated guns. The legislation is consistent with the guns-everywhere strategy the lobbying arm of the NRA has advanced at every level of government since the late 1990s—more guns in the hands of more people in more places. Dealers buy them in bulk from police departments and sell them to the public with no disclosure that such weapons were once used in robberies, assaults or homicides. In some notable cases, these guns are used to commit new crimes. Even so, efforts to expand these laws to other states are underway.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On television, cop dramas depict cavernous evidence rooms, where conscientious detectives might indulge their second thoughts about an old case and reexamine the murder weapon, still neatly tagged and boxed after all those years. (Indeed, a few crime guns do sit forever in police custody, &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/15265/" target="_blank"&gt;such as the .38-caliber revolver&lt;/a&gt; Mark David Chapman used to shoot John Lennon.) Generally, though, after guns have served their evidentiary purposes, they are either resold, destroyed or returned to the owners. (Immediately following his trial and a not-guilty verdict, &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/07/15/zimmerman_s_gun_george_zimmerman_will_get_his_kel_tec_9_pistol_back.html" target="_blank"&gt;Zimmerman’s lawyers announced that he was requesting the gun be returned to him&lt;/a&gt;, saying he feared for his safety and felt he needed to rearm himself.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never been a uniform or a perfect system. Law-enforcement agencies routinely sell seized property (such as automobiles) but destroy contraband (such as narcotics). What to do with weapons has always been a trickier issue. Back in 1992, Margaret Weigel’s gun was confiscated after her boyfriend used it to barricade himself in an apartment and threaten suicide. &lt;a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-08-28/news/1992241173_1_roulston-weigel-baltimore-county" target="_blank"&gt;She demanded the gun back, and Baltimore police grudgingly obliged&lt;/a&gt;. Her boyfriend soon got hold of it again and killed her, then himself. After that, the weapon might &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; have made it back into civilian hands, depending on which law-enforcement agency seized it. At that time, Baltimore County Police routinely destroyed crime guns, whereas Maryland State Police resold them to dealers (a practice they discontinued a year later). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this patchwork of inconsistent policies is something gun rights advocates have been trying to simplify of late—by prohibiting the destruction of crime guns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kentucky set an example in 1998,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;passing the first law prohibiting firearm destruction. This preceded the wave of 11 states that passed similar legislation between 2009 and 2014. The laws are particular to guns—other weapons, such as knives, don’t usually have enough value to make the resale effort cost-effective, and there’s no law mandating the preservation of knives or nunchucks or clubs or brass knuckles or baseball bats. In the Kentucky State Police &lt;a href="http://www.kentuckystatepolice.org/conf_weapons/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Confiscated Weapons Sale&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the only weapons you’ll find on the auction spreadsheets are firearms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the Nebraska Legislature introduced &lt;a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/Current/PDF/Intro/LB769.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a bill&lt;/a&gt; (now indefinitely postponed), that would have required the sale of forfeited guns in police custody, except in the rare circumstance that a firearm had an obvious defect that made it unsafe to fire. First to testify in support was Katie Spohn, a paid lobbyist for the National Rifle Association. “The NRA supports LB769 because it eliminates the wasteful and expensive practice of destroying firearms that could be recirculated through licensed dealers to the retail market,” Spohn said. “The NRA further supports LB769 because the proceeds from these firearms auctions would go to support our local schools.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a curious model: The more crime there is in a community, the more guns the police can seize and resell, and the better the state can compensate public schoolteachers. But it’s becoming a reliable stream of municipal revenue around the country, Spohn explained. “Police departments and other public agencies routinely sell forfeited property to the law-abiding public, including firearms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how’s that working out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a contract with an online auction house, the Duluth Police Department in Minnesota &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/new-hope-shooter-got-gun-from-straw-buyer-sheriff-says/290385351/" target="_blank"&gt;sold three confiscated guns to Raymond Kmetz&lt;/a&gt;, a man with a long history of mental illness who had previously attacked a police officer with a bulldozer. Kmetz purchased the guns online, using his own name, but he knew he wouldn’t pass a background check. So he sent another man to pick them up. That straw buyer handed the guns over to Kmetz, who used them to attack New Hope City Hall, where he &lt;a href="http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/01/26/new-hope-city-council-meeting-interrupted-by-sounds-of-gunfire" target="_blank"&gt;shot two police officers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, guns released from the custody of &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/21/news/police-guns-crimes/" target="_blank"&gt;Tennessee law enforcement agencies&lt;/a&gt; have also been used in multiple shootings—one at a Pentagon security checkpoint (leaving one dead, two injured), and another at a courthouse in Las Vegas (leaving two dead and one injured). To a local CNN affiliate, Former Memphis Mayor A.C. Wharton Jr. &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/21/news/police-guns-crimes/" target="_blank"&gt;expressed&lt;/a&gt; reservations about the city’s practice of selling guns or trading them for other equipment, but &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/21/news/police-guns-crimes/" target="_blank"&gt;told CNN Money&lt;/a&gt; the program had saved the city millions of dollars. (That is, if you don’t factor in the economic impact of gun violence itself, which runs &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/true-cost-of-gun-violence-in-america" target="_blank"&gt;at least $580,000 per victim&lt;/a&gt;. Memphis has the fourth-highest rate of gun homicide in the U.S.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, a former felon named Rudy Corpuz Jr. has an entirely different attitude about the aftermarket for guns. “If we get &lt;i&gt;one gun&lt;/i&gt; off the street, we’re winning,” he said. “That one gun right there, potentially, can save a whole community.” Corpuz is now executive director of &lt;a href="http://www.unitedplayaz.org" target="_blank"&gt;United Playaz&lt;/a&gt;, a violence-prevention group that has hosted several gun buyback events in San Francisco (in partnership with local police, who destroy guns surrendered by members of the community). To fund the buybacks, United Playaz solicited contributions from Silicon Valley tech magnates, and from medical marijuana dispensaries. People who voluntarily surrender a handgun get $100 cash, or $200 for a rifle—often less than the street value. “It’s about, honestly, just getting rid of a gun, so it won’t ever harm or hurt anybody no more,” Corpuz said. “I know some people are trying to get extra money, but more importantly, I think more people wanted to get it off the streets and out of the hands of anybody, period. Where it can be destroyed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’d be surprised who turns in guns,” Corpuz added. He related a story about one elderly woman who showed up at his buyback with nearly 30 guns—her late husband’s collection. “I used to break into people’s houses,” Corpuz said. “Imagine if I broke into her house. I would have had 30 guns. Me and my gang. Me and my crew.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know exactly who participates in gun buybacks and what motivates them. Generally, it’s a “no questions asked” arrangement, to encourage people to turn in illegal guns without fear of arrest. “We’ve done voluntary surveys of people at gun buybacks,” explains Ian Johnstone, founder of &lt;a href="http://www.gunxgun.org" target="_blank"&gt;GunXGun&lt;/a&gt;, a violence-prevention nonprofit that  partnered with Corpuz. “What we’ve learned is that north of 20 percent of people that are participating in the buybacks never wanted the gun in the first place, and it just happened to be in their possession.” That set includes thousands of Americans who inherit guns every year that were used in a relative’s suicide. Those unwanted guns can sit around indefinitely as an unpleasant reminder. “That’s the unfortunate nature of guns. They don’t go bad. They just sit there. They last and they present this everlasting threat until they are taken out of circulation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-03-17-gun-buybacks_N.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Critics&lt;/a&gt; of gun buybacks have compared the effort to draining the ocean with a bucket. (Recent buyback events in San Francisco, for example, have taken in just a few hundred guns.)&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Lawmakers in Arizona reiterated doubts about the crime-prevention merits of gun buybacks when they passed a bill in 2013 &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-arizona-idUSBRE93T04120130430" target="_blank"&gt;requiring municipalities to resell any guns turned in through buyback programs&lt;/a&gt;, instead of melting them down. In a spectacular display of cognitive dissonance, sponsors of the bill argued that the guns being turned in were worthless, broken junk that could never be used in a crime and that the guns were too valuable to be destroyed and instead should be sold to generate revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true: In a nation with hundreds of millions of guns, &lt;a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2015/07/gun-buyback-study-effectivness/" target="_blank"&gt;we’ll never get rid of all of them&lt;/a&gt;. But with legislation like this, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to really get rid of even one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Is Sanders 2016 Becoming Nader 2000?</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/is-sanders-2016-becoming-nader-2000-213893</link>
      <description>How Bernie could cost Hillary the election.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bernie Sanders, for all his talk of revolution, never wanted to be Ralph Nader. He has a long history of keeping the Democratic Party at arm’s length, but he also has a long history of rejecting spoiler bids. Since 1992, he has always endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee, snubbing Nader’s four left-wing third-party campaigns. He became a Democrat to run for president instead of keeping his “(I)” and following in Nader’s footsteps. He has pledged to support Hillary Clinton if she wins the Democratic nomination and has ripped Donald Trump at every opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if Sanders isn’t deliberately trying to replicate the electoral trauma inflicted by Nader in 2000—when he probably cost Al Gore the presidency—Bernie’s lingering presence in the Democratic primary threatens to produce a similar result in November: delegitimizing the eventual Democratic nominee in the eyes of the left and sending many critics, if not to Trump, then to the Green Party’s Jill Stein or the Libertarian Party’s Gary Johnson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first poll to assess the impact of third-party candidates, &lt;a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/05/gop-quickly-unifies-around-trump-clinton-still-has-modest-lead.html" target="_blank"&gt;Public Policy Polling&lt;/a&gt; found last week that the inclusion of Stein and Johnson shaves 2 percentage points off Clinton’s lead over Trump. Conversely, the minor party duo loses a combined 2 points when Sanders is tested as the Democratic nominee, indicating that Sanders’ voters account for Clinton’s reduced standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple points, a couple million voters, is no big deal to Clinton if she’s trouncing Trump. But if he makes it a race, Democrats may find their political post-traumatic stress disorder from 2000 flaring up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Clinton would be the most enraged if she suffers Gore’s fate, it is not in Sanders’ interest to join Nader on the Democratic Party’s unofficial Wall of Shame. His ultimate goal is to remake the party in his progressive populist image. He can’t do that if his name is uttered by rank-and-file Democrats only when seething.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means Sanders has to strategize very carefully as he prepares to leave his mark at the convention. How can he bend the party to his will without breaking it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way would be to follow the lead of Jesse Jackson in 1988, who remained in the race for the entire primary. But when he came to the Democratic convention with &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=zSis8eWVwvYC&amp;amp;lpg=PA14&amp;amp;ots=hJ6wLlegE-&amp;amp;dq=jesse%20jackson%20texas%20caucus%201988&amp;amp;pg=PA14#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=1%2C075%20delegates&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank"&gt;38 percent of the pledged delegates&lt;/a&gt;, he went to great lengths to keep his team focused on changing the party over the long haul rather than disrupting the election (though Michael Dukakis still lost). “I’m going to ask you to do a hard thing&lt;i&gt;,”&lt;/i&gt; Jackson said to his delegates&lt;i&gt;, “&lt;/i&gt;Put your focus on why we're here. If you're following my lead, then reflect my spirit, attitude and discipline. We don't have the time to fill up the media airwaves with pollution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A runner-up staying in until the last presidential primary vote is counted, by itself, has never been tantamount to a fatal party schism. Clinton’s reluctance in the spring of 2008 to accept the delegate math did not prevent Barack Obama from becoming the first Democrat to break 51 percent of the popular vote since Lyndon B. Johnson. Jerry Brown’s refusal to endorse his 1992 rival Bill Clinton proved to be about as damaging as a spitball. In the &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/what-nevertrump-can-learn-from-anybody-but-carter-213860" target="_blank"&gt;spring of 1976&lt;/a&gt;, Brown and Sen. Frank Church &lt;i&gt;entered&lt;/i&gt; the presidential race—and won several late contests—in a futile attempt to stop Jimmy Carter from winning the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson didn’t quit before it was officially over for the same reason Sanders won’t: more delegates means more influence at the convention. But that’s where Sanders faces a paradox. The potential of using his delegates to make her convention disorderly—forcing floor fights over platform language, nominating himself on the floor, withholding his endorsement—is what gives him leverage. But to unleash convention chaos risks a &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/bernie-sanders-eugene-mccarthy-1968-213828?o=1" target="_blank"&gt;repeat of 1968&lt;/a&gt;, when efforts by Eugene McCarthy’s delegates to wrest the nomination from Hubert Humphrey and include an anti-Vietnam War plank to the platform failed on the convention floor, prompting a livid McCarthy to leave the convention without endorsing the ticket. He gave an extremely reluctant endorsement in the campaign’s final days, and his unwillingness to rally his supporters possibly tipped five states to the Republican winner Richard Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely that Sanders would renege on his pledge to back the eventual nominee, but a passive-aggressive “nondorsement”—just keeping quiet—or a feeble campaign trail schedule could still stir hostile feelings among his supporters that the party establishment treated their campaign unfairly and views their revolution with disdain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might Sanders walk the fine line he needs to—pushing hard for his ideal platform without poisoning the party well?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most potent move he could make without sacrificing his policy agenda would be to declare, after the last ballot is cast in the District of Columbia on June 14, that Hillary Clinton won the majority of the pledged delegates “fair and square.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A faction of Sanders supporters continues to circulate notions that the game has been rigged, either by the rules— unelected superdelegates and primaries closed to independents—or by outright cheating, with the long lines to vote in Arizona and Bernie-friendly early exit poll data looming large in online conspiracy theories. Sanders has not done much to promulgate the conspiracies, but neither has he tried hard to shut them down. He does regularly complain about superdelegates and closed primaries, despite the fact that he lost 13 of the 21 primaries so far in which independents could vote, and that the distribution of superdelegates on the basis of the popular vote would not give him the overall delegate lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, he didn’t lose because of the rules. But if his supporters are left with the impression that rules were designed by the party to thwart their ambitions, then they will have little hesitation to bolt the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders could ditch his strident anti-establishment tone and help disabuse his supporters of their suspicions, closing the electoral chapter of the campaign with a speech along the lines of: “Our campaign performed exponentially better than anyone predicted. We worked together to raise enough money to be heard, and our message was heard. We fought for more debates, we got them and we engaged in a substantive dialogue of ideas. We should take enormous pride in winning [probably by then] more than 20 states and 45 percent of the pledged delegates, while we also tip our hat to Hillary Clinton for winning a little more. Our party’s commitment to democracy gave us a fair shot, and the proof is in how well we did in the face of the long odds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declaring the process to be on the level would effectively table a floor fight over the primary process rules that &lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/video/sanders-devotees-warn-of-drama-for-clinton-at-dnc/093B7952-D3DD-4913-8FD6-F53D6CD650AC.html" target="_blank"&gt;some Sanders allies have been hankering for&lt;/a&gt;, and keep the convention spotlight on what Sanders ran to accomplish in the first place: to popularize policy proposals that would break up the banks, provide free college, extend Medicare for all and eliminate corporate campaign cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional subtext of such a message would be to assure his supporters, “the Democratic Party is our home,” countering the message being sold by the third-party candidates that it is impossible for Sandernistas to advance their revolution within the confines of the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1988, Jesse Jackson faced a similar challenge in keeping his restless supporters in the party fold, while also pressing the Dukakis camp for substantive concessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he took a highly calibrated approach to the party. He negotiated with Dukakis’ aides &lt;a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/is-the-democrats-new-harmony-for-real-19880908" target="_blank"&gt;a platform that reflected much of his liberal agenda&lt;/a&gt;, though scrubbed of elements deemed too controversial. Three planks left out were brought to the floor for debate, but Jackson &lt;a href="http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-07-20/news/8802110930_1_jackson-proposal-dukakis-campaign-plank" target="_blank"&gt;did not force a floor vote&lt;/a&gt; on the most divisive of the three: “self-determination” for Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moral victory of exercising influence over the platform may have looked ephemeral in the years that followed: The defeat of Dukakis was blamed on excessive liberalism, leading to the 1992 nomination of Bill Clinton who took the party in a moderate direction. But &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2000/03/jesse-jackson-mother-jones-interview" target="_blank"&gt;Jackson in 2000 enthused&lt;/a&gt; at how much he was able to influence the White House in the Clinton years as well as catapult his top staffers into the Democratic Party apparatus. And had he not kept his supporters inside the Democratic tent, neither Clinton’s presidency nor Obama’s more liberal administration would have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders never endorsed Nader, but he did endorse Jackson in 1988. If he wants his 2016 campaign to leave a lasting legacy on the Democratic Party, he’ll walk Jackson’s path at the convention, and do everything he can to prevent his supporters from walking Nader’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Democrats turn to Schumer to fix Sanders rift</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/chuck-schumer-peacemaker-sanders-clinton-223434</link>
      <description>The New York senator has longstanding ties to both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As Hillary Clinton becomes increasingly frustrated with Bernie Sanders’ dogged campaign against the party establishment, Democrats backing the front-runner have recently begun looking to a peacemaker: Sen. Chuck Schumer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Schumer has been telling lawmakers in recent days he believes he could be a helpful bridge between the two feuding camps, a Democratic source familiar with the conversations said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York senator enjoys a close relationship with Clinton, whom he helped usher into politics when she served as his junior senator. A Clinton “true believer,” as close allies describe him, Schumer began urging her to run for president three years ago. He campaigned hard for her in her adopted home state last month, and speaks to her regularly on the phone, insiders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future Democratic Leader has much riding on Clinton’s candidacy. Schumer has had a rocky relationship with the Obama White House, one that became more strained after he refused to back the president’s Iran nuclear deal last August. If Clinton assumes the White House next January, the longtime New York senator would ascend to a party leadership role with an ally to work with in the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Schumer also has longstanding ties to Sanders — both senators are sons of Brooklyn, with the accents to prove it, and were fellow students at James Madison High School in Gravesend. Schumer also helped recruit and coach Sanders for his Senate run in 2006 — and it was Schumer who lured the populist Vermonter to the gilded Democratic donor retreat in Martha’s Vineyard for the annual Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraiser last year, according to insiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his closeness with Clinton, Schumer has maintained an open channel of communication directly to Sanders and the two colleagues “talk regularly,” according to a source close to Sanders. Sanders camp called the relationship between the two senators one of “collegiality and mutual respect.” But Schumer's warm relationship with Wall Street has created tensions with Sanders -- and many progressives remain skeptical of him. Those tensions could potentially limit any role he might play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schumer has another Sanders connection: a longstanding relationship with Sanders’ senior strategist Tad Devine dating back to 1988, when he was a congressman serving on the convention rules committee and Devine was lead rules committee negotiator for nominee Michael Dukakis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Democrats backing Clinton are beginning to push the idea of Schumer as the party uniter -- ideally, they say, stepping in around the California primary on June 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He is well-positioned to try and help achieve a meeting of the minds and a unification of both sides,” said Geoff Garin, a veteran strategist of Clinton’s 2008 campaign who now works for the super PAC backing her, Priorities USA. “He is trusted and respected by both sides and there probably isn’t a long list of people who meet that description.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of another potential unifier, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Garin said: “She doesn’t have the same relationship with the Clinton campaign. Chuck Schumer certainly makes sense as the right person at the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Schumer operative and Democratic strategist Stu Loeser added: “Chuck Schumer is extraordinarily able to find political common ground between people. What’s fueled his success in the Senate is his ability to get political and ideological opposites to agree on issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loeser said Schumer is the ideal person to bring Sanders back into the fold. Despite Schumer’s base of power in the moderate wing of the party, Loeser said, “he is deeply respectful of the side of the party that Bernie Sanders is giving voice to. He doesn’t see this as an either/or choice for the Democratic party. A navy needs aircraft carriers and it needs battleships. They have different functions, they work differently. But you need both to win a war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, according to a senior Democratic aide, &amp;quot;there are very intense conversations with Bernie going on, but Schumer is nowhere near them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Schumer, insiders said, is only interested in playing the role of peacemaker at the right time -- he is hesitant to appear to be pressuring Sanders too early, for fear of alienating any of his Senate colleagues before he has even assumed his leadership post. That’s part of why he has not criticized Sanders even as other Senate Democrats are becoming increasingly concerned about a gaping divide in the party, people familiar with his thinking said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California Sen. Dianne Feinstein told CNN on Wednesday that Sanders’ intention to take his campaign to the July convention “worries me a great deal” because of the outbursts by his supporters at the Nevada Democratic Convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;And many of Sanders’ Senate colleagues were outraged at the treatment of Sen. Barbara Boxer in Nevada last week. &amp;quot;I feared for my safety and I had a lot of security around me,&amp;quot; she told CNN. &amp;quot;I've never had anything like this happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said Sanders faces a “test of leadership” in how he gets his supporters in line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schumer, in contrast, has assiduously avoided dropping even one public note of concern or critique about Sanders. “Schumer is going to be leader and he needs Bernie to be helpful and listen to him, not be a bomb-thrower when he gets back to the Senate,” said another Schumer ally of his resistance to publicly criticize his colleague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Sanders needs Schumer: as the likely next Democratic leader, Schumer would have the clout to help determine his future role and power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will play whatever role either campaign wants me to play to be helpful,” Schumer said in a diplomatic statement Friday. “I know Bernie -- he’s a very good, thoughtful person and he will play a constructive role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Clinton and Sanders campaigns declined to speak to a Schumer’s potential role in facilitating a party reconciliation, former Obama strategist David Axelrod suggested he was a natural fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They both speak Brooklyn,” said Axelrod, “so that's a start.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>House erupts in chaos after LGBT vote</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/house-lgbt-amendment-discrimination-fight-223366</link>
      <description>GOP leaders barely muscled up the votes to reject an amendment that would have barred federal contractors from getting government work if they discriminate against the LGBT community.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The House erupted in chaos Thursday morning with Democrats crying foul after Republicans hastily persuaded a few of their own to switch their votes and narrowly block an amendment intended to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an unruly scene on the floor with Democrats chanting, &amp;quot;Shame!&amp;quot; after GOP leaders  barely muscled up the votes to reject, 212-213, an amendment by Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) that would have effectively barred federal contractors from getting government work if they discriminate against the LGBT community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, a monitor in the House gallery showed there were 217 votes supporting the legislation, eliciting cheers of joy from Democrats who thought the measure might actually pass. But over the course of about 10 minutes, those votes suddenly dropped one by one to 212 — and the amendment failed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A number of lawmakers from western states, who originally voted yes, changed their votes. According to a list tweeted out an hour after the vote by House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer’s (D-Md.) office, they included: California Reps. Darrell Issa, David Valadao, Jeff Denham, Mimi Walters, and Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, Rep. David Yong of Iowa and Rep. Bruce Poliquin of Maine. Their offices have not yet responded to a request for comment &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maloney, the amendment's author, was furious with Republicans for how they handled the floor fight over his offering. He singled out Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in particular for criticism, saying the No. 2 House Republican personally lobbied GOP members to change their votes when it looked like Maloney's proposal would pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The leader [McCarthy] went around and twisted their arms, and they voted for discrimination,&amp;quot; Maloney said. When Maloney complained directly to McCarthy, he said the majority leader told him &amp;quot;to get back on your own side.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The members who switched are going to hold a very special place in American history as the people who didn't have the guts to stand up and support the will of the House,&amp;quot; Maloney said off the chamber floor after the vote. &amp;quot;They literally snatched discrimination out of the jaws of equality.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GOP aide on the floor at the time said Maloney was actually the instigator, telling POLITICO that he came over to the Republican side and was angrily taunting conservatives for their votes. Republicans are saying privately that if the amendment had passed, it would have killed the appropriations bill because Republicans would no longer vote for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our veterans and troops were prioritized over a political messaging amendment that could have jeopardized the final passage of the appropriations bill,&amp;quot; said Speaker Paul Ryan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fracas highlights the risks for GOP leadership's commitment to an &amp;quot;open amendment&amp;quot; process, where lawmakers are afforded wide latitude to offer changes to legislation, like the military construction and veterans affairs spending bill that was on the floor Thursday. Ryan, upon taking the gavel, vowed he would allow more amendments on the floor, but Thursday's drama will surely test his commitment to that process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a good bet that other politically explosive issues will come up for votes if the Wisconsin Republican and his team continue the same practice through this summer's spending bill process, so Ryan will have to determine whether the benefits outweigh the cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acrimony undermined a success for Ryan earlier that day regarding his commitment to regular order. Just moments before the LGBT vote, he’d shepherded &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/paul-ryan-house-confederate-flag-vote-223361" target="_blank"&gt;the first House vote &lt;/a&gt;to bar the Confederate flag from flying in mass graves at federal cemeteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;same amendment had tripped up Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) last year, and Boehner responded then by pulling an entire appropriations bill off the floor because he didn't want to litigate the matter. He feared it would divide his conference and make it look bad following a high-profile racially charged shooting of black churchgoers in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, however,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;GOP leaders were proud that they allowed the Democratic flag amendment on the floor.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;It passed 265-159, with all members of GOP leadership joining Democrats to back the measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just moments later, things turned ugly during the LGBT vote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the votes began shifting out of the 'aye' column on Maloney's measure, booing erupted in the chamber. Almost every Democrat was on his or her feet shouting and eventually they broke out in a chant, pointing their fingers at the other side of the chamber where the Republicans sit: “Shame! Shame! Shame!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y) framed his hands around his mouth like a megaphone and shouted something no one could hear over the din. Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) had his hands crossed and wore a sharp scowl. Rep. Rosa DeLauro raised her hands in the air during the chanting. Others paced, while some just stood in shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans on the other side sat in their seats quietly. Some looked disappointed. As the amendment was being voted down, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen appeared to shake her head in disappointment. The Florida Republican has a transgender son and is one of the few Republicans who has been outspoken in advocating for the LGBT community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the chair closed the vote, Democrats continued shouting in anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There will be order in this chamber,” the chair said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No there will not be!” yelled Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), who stood at the base of the podium. She pounded her fists on the table in front of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoyer silenced the chamber and called for a parliamentary inquiry to find out&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;how people switched their votes on an amendment that, until just moments before, looked like it would pass. Under House rules, once the speaker asks, &amp;quot;Does anyone wish to change their vote?&amp;quot; lawmakers are supposed to go to the front of the podium to change their votes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the speaker, however, never said that phrase during the LGBT ballot, keeping the vote open for longer than the standard two-minute voting block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoyer argued that Ryan was tossing chamber rules aside and said the people who changed their votes should have the courage to step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was standing in the well. No one came, or no one had the courage to come into the well to change their vote,” he thundered. “Notwithstanding that, the vote just came changing. How is that possible?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoyer also threatened on the floor that Democrats would figure out who switched their votes on the amendment: &amp;quot;We will know. We're working on it right now,&amp;quot; Hoyer told reporters after the vote. His office released the names a few minutes later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the second time in as many days that Maloney offered the proposal on the floor. The House rejected similar language last night during debate over the defense authorization bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been the majority leader. I’ve been the whip,” Hoyer said on the floor after the vote as he blamed GOP leadership for pushing lawmakers to switch their votes. But he again hit the seven Republicans who changed their positions. “They will have themselves to look at tonight in the mirror and explain to themselves whether their first vote was a principled one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions (R-Texas) said some lawmakers may have switched their votes because they recognized that the issue had been settled the night before during the defense authorization debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sessions also defended the GOP on the substance of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am a Republican,” he said. “We do not discriminate — we attempt to follow the law, and the gentleman knows that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Trump's Supreme Court picks have close ties to GOP senators</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-supreme-court-senators-223387</link>
      <description>A brother, a former law professor and several acquaintances of lawmakers make his list.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sen. John Cornyn is a personal acquaintance of Don Willett, one of the people on Donald Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees: Both men share the distinction of having served on Texas’ highest court. Another Trump favorite, Thomas Lee, is the brother of Utah Sen. Mike Lee. Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Eid was once Sen. Cory Gardner’s law professor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley was so pleased with an Iowa judge included on Trump’s list that the senator said he would’ve personally recommended Steven Colloton to a future president considering a high court justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In selecting names for his list of potential Supreme Court picks, Trump seemed to make direct appeals to Senate Republicans by choosing their associates and even relatives, along with jurists who have long been household names among conservatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willett – a colorful and prolific Twitter user who now serves on the Texas Supreme Court – knows Cornyn well, the No. 2 Senate Republican said on Thursday. The two men didn’t serve at the same time, but Cornyn called him a “good man” and “kind of a unique guy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know Judge Willett’s judicial philosophy is one of interpreting the law as written and the Constitution, and not, sort of, making it up as you go along,” said Cornyn, who also sits on the Judiciary Committee. Noting the concern from other Republicans about whom a President Trump would choose, Cornyn added: “That’s why I thought this was a smart move, in reassuring (the party).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Republican senators still can’t bring themselves to fully embrace Trump as their presidential standard-bearer. But his long list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court is already going a long way in assuaging their concerns, GOP senators said after the presumptive Republican nominee’s unorthodox move to name 11 judges he’d consider for the nation's most powerful court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has pointedly refused to endorse Trump, said the list of potential justices was a “very good step in the right direction.&amp;quot; Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump’s harshest critics, said the presumptive nominee has provided a “good, solid list.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee, the Utah senator, endorsed Trump rival Ted Cruz and said last week that the billionaire business mogul “scares me to death.” But Lee found nothing to knock about Trump’s Supreme Court list, considering his older brother — who serves on the Utah Supreme Court and clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas — was among the judges Trump named. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don't know everyone on the list, but those I do know would all be great Supreme Court justices,” Mike Lee said in an e-mailed statement. “Of course I do believe one name on that list stands head and shoulders above the rest.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah’s other senator, Republican Orrin Hatch, is also a fan of Trump’s pick from his home state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s a very bright guy,” Hatch said of Thomas Lee. “He would be excellent, if they could get him there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all Senate Republicans have joined together for more than two months to block President Barack Obama’s pick for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland. If Trump wins, they can now rest assured that their controversial blockade is likely to pay off with a much more conservative nominee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 11 people listed by Trump are considered solid conservative jurists, with five of them having clerked for Supreme Court justices revered by the right and six having been appointed to the federal judiciary by President George W. Bush. Trump also picked generously from a list of suggested justices put together by the conservative Heritage Foundation, and many names have ties to The Federalist Society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s the personal connections on Trump’s list that stand out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eid, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas who serves on the Colorado Supreme Court, was Gardner’s law professor when the now-senator attended the University of Colorado at Boulder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ones I’ve seen were pretty well thought,” Gardner said. “I’d be very curious to see Hillary Clinton’s list. And I think the American people would be scared out of their mind by Hillary Clinton’s list.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman who would likely wield considerable influence over Supreme Court nominees if a Republican were in the White House, recalled that he personally recommended Colloton to Bush for the judge’s current position on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Judiciary chairman said he wasn’t consulted by the Trump campaign on the names, but it appeared the Iowa senator and the presumptive GOP nominee were of one mind at least on this matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He clerked for Chief Justice [William] Rehnquist. That ought to tell you something about him,” Grassley said of Colloton. “If we have a Republican president, and if there hadn’t been a list out like this, I would’ve been suggesting him to be considered by the next president.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other judges listed by Trump include: Raymond Gruender of Missouri, Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, Joan Larsen of Michigan, William Pryor of Alabama, David Stras of Minnesota and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin. Sykes is the ex-wife of conservative radio host Charlie Sykes, a known Trump critic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s decision to release a menu of potential Supreme Court justices — a highly unusual move for a presidential candidate — had been telegraphed for some time. When the businessman met with a handful of lawmakers in March, he pledged shortly after that he would draw up a list of justices he would choose when Supreme Court vacancies arise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservatives, particularly the influential anti-abortion movement, have been skeptical of Trump on the hot-button issue of the Supreme Court, considering the nominee had a history of vacillating on key topics over the course of his campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Trump seems to have calmed those worries somewhat. When asked whether the list would go a long way in assuaging concerns about Trump’s capacity to pick justices acceptable to Republicans, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump’s first endorser in the Senate, responded: “Huge.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard nothing but positive about this,” Sessions said of Trump’s names. “People in the Senate say this is going to relieve a lot of people. They were hearing a lot of concerns that he may not appoint sound jurists.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) doesn’t know any of Trump’s picks personally. But as a member of the Judiciary Committee, he is likely to play an outsized role in future Supreme Court nominations. He said he was beginning to research the backgrounds of all of Trump’s potential nominees, but called them “viable candidates” for a seat on the nation’s high court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They ought to see this as this candidate bending over backwards to do something that is pretty unusual,” Perdue said of conservative critics of Trump. “They should see this as an attempt to ameliorate their concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Burgess Everett contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The holes in the overtime rule</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/05/holes-in-the-overtime-rule-000124</link>
      <description>Despite Obama's sweeping new regulation, America's 1930s-era labor law is still leaving a strange assortment of workers in the cold.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the American workplace got a huge jolt when President Barack Obama &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/obama-rushes-out-rules-to-guarantee-legacy-223301" target="_blank"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; his new overtime rule, sharply expanding the number of people who qualify for overtime pay. According to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, more than 12 million people will be affected by the rule, which among other things raised the salary threshold for receiving overtime and imposed an automatic adjustment every three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But behind the headline was a strange fact about the U.S. job market that the rule largely left unchanged: A &lt;a href="http://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/screen75.asp" target="_blank"&gt;huge list&lt;/a&gt; of American jobs are specifically exempt from overtime. They include airline employees, truckers, and railroad workers, as well as farm laborers, home-based wreathmakers (really) and rural elevator operators. The administration’s overtime regulation estimates that up to 4.5 million workers fall into these categories, including up to 2 million Americans in transportation and 900,000 in agriculture work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these are exempt for obscure reasons dating back to the 1930s, but there's one big shift that has left some workers out in the cold. Decades ago, legal protections for many of them &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2000/12/art3full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;seemed&lt;/a&gt; less important—even undesirable—because they had the backing of powerful labor unions to negotiate wages and safe working conditions on their behalf. But the decline of unions have left such workers unprotected in the modern labor force, covered neither by the law nor by a strong union contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overtime exemptions are as old as the underlying law, called the Fair Labor Standards Act, originally passed in 1938. A host of political compromises left some workers out of the overtime requirement; historians &lt;a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/hamlrv12&amp;amp;div=47&amp;amp;id=&amp;amp;page=" target="_blank"&gt;generally attribute&lt;/a&gt; the exemption for farmworkers and domestic workers, who at the time were both mainly black, to the need to get the support of Southern lawmakers. Various other exemptions also seem outdated today, such as one for switchboard operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other situations, the exemptions still make sense. That includes an exemption for seamen, who often are out at sea for weeks at a time. Determining what overtime means for workers who spend weeks working and then weeks off would have been a significant challenge for the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of them are designed to cover jobs where tracking hours and OT just don’t make sense, like door to door salesmen,” James Sherk, a research fellow in labor economics at the Heritage Foundation, wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other occupations, though, the exemptions have a more surprising origin: labor unions didn't want those workers covered. Many labor leaders worried the FLSA would limit their ability to collectively bargain with employers. For that reason, many heavily unionized industries, like trucking, are exempt from overtime regulations; in the 1930s, the drivers didn’t need the labor protections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The teamsters were the strongest union on earth, and they had huge density. The fact that the Fair Labor Standards Act didn’t set overtime hours for them didn’t matter,” said Ross Eisenbrey, the vice president of the Economic Policy Institute. Today unions still ask for carve-outs; after Los Angeles passed a $15 minimum wage last year, local unions requested an exemption from it, prompting cries of hypocrisy among conservative groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the FSLA was passed in 1938, 29 percent of all non-agricultural workers were in a union. That number peaked in 1954 at 34.7 percent. But today, it has plunged—just 7.5 percent of non-farm employees were unionized in 2015. Yet, the carve-outs remain, leaving millions of workers unprotected either by unions, or by federal overtime law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When policymakers generally talk about updating the overtime regulations, they are referring to the rules surrounding which workers qualify for a “white collar” exemption. The FLSA exempted workers engaged in executive, administrative and professional work but left it up the Department of Labor to determine who fits that description. The new overtime rule updates who qualifies for that exemption, so that fewer people are exempt. (All hourly and blue collar workers qualify for overtime.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the exemptions for many other industries specifically mentioned in the FLSA—even for outdated reasons—aren't something Obama has the power to fix. They're written into the law, and would fall to Congress. There's little interest in a Republican Congress in updating the law to allow more workers to qualify for overtime. State and local governments have attempted to fill some of these holes with labor regulations of their own, said Sachin Pandya, a law professor at the University of Connecticut who writes frequently about the FLSA. But many workers can still fall between the cracks, especially in states with weak labor laws. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new overtime rule comes amid a broader debate about the future of the labor market, as more and more workers &lt;a href="https://krueger.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/akrueger/files/katz_krueger_cws_-_march_29_20165.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;are classified&lt;/a&gt; as independent contractors. Under that classification, workers not only do not qualify under overtime and minimum wage laws, they also don’t receive benefits like health insurance, pay into worker’s comp and unemployment insurance and aren’t covered my most anti-discrimination statutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policymakers are grappling with how to ensure workers are protected in this changing work environment. Some &lt;a href="http://democracyjournal.org/magazine/37/shared-security-shared-growth/" target="_blank"&gt;have proposed&lt;/a&gt; a portable benefit package that accrues based on hours worked without ties to a singular employer. Two former Obama administration officials &lt;a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/modernizing_labor_laws_for_twenty_first_century_work_krueger_harris.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; a third worker classification may be needed for workers, such as Uber drivers, whose job doesn’t fit neatly as either a traditional employee or independent contractor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future of overtime is intricately tied into these ideas, especially if the number of independent contractors continues to grow. Obama’s new rule is a reminder that the labor laws of the 1930s may need a much deeper updating in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>High-speed rail gets a four-year delay</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/05/high-speed-rail-gets-a-four-year-delay-000123</link>
      <description>The California bullet train megaproject was even less shovel-ready than advertised.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-speed rail is turning out to be a slow-speed proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first segment of California’s first-in-the-nation bullet-train project, currently scheduled for completion in 2018, will not be done until the end of 2022, according to a contract revision the Obama administration quietly approved this morning. That initial 119-mile segment through the relatively flat and empty Central Valley was considered the easiest-to-build stretch of a planned $64 billion line, which is eventually supposed to zip passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles in under three hours. So the four-year delay is sure to spark new doubts about whether the state’s—and perhaps the nation’s—most controversial and expensive infrastructure project will ever reach its destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Four years? It just shows that something deep inside this project has gone terribly wrong,” says state legislator Jim Patterson, a Fresno Republican who recently shepherded a bill to increase oversight of high-speed rail through the Democratic-controlled assembly. “The time is coming where we’re going to have to call a halt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State and federal officials downplayed the shift in the timetable, saying it partly reflected more ambitious plans for the Central Valley work, and in any case merely ratified construction realities on the ground. Jeff Morales, CEO of the California High-Speed Rail Authority, said his agency is accelerating its pace after a painfully slow start, with a half dozen construction crews now building overpasses, relocating utilities, and demolishing structures from north of Fresno down to the Bakersfield area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early on, there was a vision, but no clear sense of how to implement that vision,” Morales said. “We have that now, and we’re moving ahead aggressively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the authority has yet to lay any tracks, and it has purchased less than half the land it needs in the Central Valley. Today’s official acknowledgment of the postponed construction deadlines is a setback not only for the high-profile California project, but for President Obama’s fading dream of bringing America the super-fast passenger rail that has become commonplace in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama’s 2009 stimulus package financed two bullet trains, but Florida’s Republican governor, Rick Scott, killed the one that was supposed to connect Tampa, Orlando, and Miami. That left the California train, with proposed speeds of up to 220 miles per hour, as the test track for the country. And while the state’s Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, has backed high-speed rail as a greener alternative to long drives and short flights that will ease congestion on freeways and runways, the project has encountered a slew of political, financial, legal and logistical obstacles over the last seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Railroad Administration officials assigned much of the blame for the lags to the project’s vociferous critics, who have tied it up with a tangle of lawsuits, administrative challenges, and other red tape. They complained that the opponents, especially Central Valley farmers and other not-in-my-back-yard landowners, have gotten far more traction against the railway than they would have against a highway, reflecting a cultural and political bias in favor of traditional asphalt infrastructure. But while they described today’s agreement as a routine bureaucratic clarification, they said they expect an explosive reaction from opponents looking to score political points in Sacramento and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re just doing due diligence, but everything about California high-speed rail gets magnified and overblown,” said FRA head Sarah Feinberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the project’s viability, however, extend well beyond NIMBY-ism and car-bias. The estimated price tag is now equivalent to 35 times the annual federal subsidy for Amtrak. The state’s voters approved $9 billion in bonds for high-speed rail, and Brown has diverted some revenue from California’s carbon trading program to the project, but Republicans shut off the federal spigot when they took back the House of Representatives in 2010. So while Morales says there’s enough money to extend the railway north to San Jose, there’s not yet a long-term funding source to finish the entire job. There is some optimism that private firms can help finance construction in anticipation of profits from running the line, but there is also widespread skepticism about the state’s rosy ridership forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the choice to start in the middle, in the sparsely populated and economically depressed Central Valley rather than the dense metropolitan areas to the north and south, has been ridiculed as a recipe for a high-priced train to nowhere. The first segment is actually designed to terminate in an empty lot north of Bakersfield. And the authority recently reversed its plans for its second segment, abruptly announcing that it will head north instead of south—understandable given the engineering challenge of tunneling through mountains en route to Los Angeles, but projecting a bit of a whoopsy-daisy vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like a Saturday Night Live skit,” Patterson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original rationale for starting in the middle was that all stimulus dollars had to be spent by September 2017, and the Central Valley run seemed relatively “shovel-ready.” It didn’t require massive urban redevelopment or daunting tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, though, even the out-of-the-way Central Valley section was less shovel-ready than expected. There have been bitter lawsuits over financing and environmental permitting. There have been protracted negotiations over many of the 1400 parcels the state needs to purchase or seize through eminent domain. As late as 2012, California’s high-speed rail agency had just a dozen employees overseeing the megaproject. And after Brown secured the carbon-trading money, the authority expanded its initial scope of work to include electrification of the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales said the agency is now moving fast enough to spend every dime of its $2.5 billion in stimulus money over the next 15 months, so it wouldn’t have to return any to the Treasury. But it has barely spent half that much over the 77 months since it was first selected for the grant. It hasn’t even put out the contract for the tracks and signaling system in the Central Valley segment. Today’s grant amendment will essentially advance the agency $60 million from the Treasury, so it will have a pot of ready money for land purchases and other time-sensitive expenditures instead of having to wait out the unwieldy federal reimbursement process. But that accommodation could become yet another lightning rod for congressional critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the state does spend its federal cash by 2017 and finishes the Central Valley leg by 2022, it will still be years away from a commercially viable system linking the state’s major metropolitan areas. Morales hopes to connect the Central Valley to Silicon Valley by 2025, cutting travel times between Fresno and San Jose by two thirds, but the real payoff won’t come until the line connects the megalopolises of northern and southern California, and it's not clear the political system has the patience to wait. Brown has been a staunch advocate, but Republican politicians in California have been adamantly anti-rail, and even California Democrats like Brown’s lieutenant governor and possible successor, Gavin Newsom, have expressed doubts about the mega-project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there has been little progress anywhere else outside California towards Obama’s ambitious vision of a national network of sleek bullet trains. America has the world’s best freight rail, but its inter-city passenger rail is a global joke. The stimulus did boost speeds and improve reliability on some Amtrak lines, like Chicago-St. Louis and Seattle-Portland, but those routes still don't qualify as &amp;quot;high-speed.” Amtrak’s popular Acela service between Boston and Washington does reach 150 miles per hour, but its average speeds are only about half that. Some techies, most prominently Tesla founder Elon Musk, believe the next big thing in mass transportation will be a “Hyperloop” that can propel passengers through vacuum tubes at 700 m.p.h. Trains are at risk of becoming pass&amp;eacute; before the U.S. can mount a serious effort to build a fast one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But high-speed rail aficionados think the California project can still become a national model for relieving congestion and accommodating growth in a low-carbon era. The key, they say, is to get the tracks in the ground, to make completion seem inevitable. The project has already created work for 266 small businesses throughout the state and hundreds of workers in the Central Valley, where unemployment is double the state average, and the authority hopes to launch at least a half-dozen additional job sites over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very real now,” Morales said. “People can see that we’re making progress. Obviously, what we need to do is maintain that progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Improving Saudi-Israeli relations offers an opportunity for the U.S.—and a big risk</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/05/improving-saudi-israeli-relations-iran-deal-united-states-000122</link>
      <description/>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a new Middle East marked by a rising Iran, one of the least talked about but perhaps most significant developments is the quiet rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Burgeoning ties between the two nations are built on the shared sense of betrayal and abandonment by a Washington seemingly interested in building a modus vivendi with Iran and withdrawing from the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising security cooperation between Riyadh and Tel Aviv provides new opportunities for the U.S. to develop a broader security apparatus in the Middle East. But it also carries major risks that the U.S. will further lose influence in the region and leave our military and diplomatic leaders unprepared for future events. A less influential Washington would put U.S. security at risk, especially on countering terrorism and violent extremism threats to the homeland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama has the opportunity in his remaining months in office to restore some standing with U.S. allies in the region. But his desire to provide Iran with much-needed space to emerge as a potentially less hostile nation often conflicts with those in the region who prefer a strategy of containment. Balancing those interests is a task that will fall largely to the next president, particularly on whether the United States should foster closer Israeli-Saudi security cooperation against Iran. That decision will have lasting consequences for American interests with the three most important nations in the region for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until Obama’s decision to engage with Iran, U.S. policy had been largely consistent toward Tehran since the Iranian revolution in 1979: furtive, secret outreach to Iranian “moderates” combined with active military, diplomatic, intelligence and financial containment. The U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia have long acted individually and collectively to contain and roll back Iran in the region. The U.S. first placed Iran on its list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1984 and has led the global coalition to isolate Iran from investors and the international financial system, and provided Gulf Arab nations with military hardware and training. The U.S. also fought Iranian trained and equipped forces in Iraq. Israel has reportedly long targeted Iranian weapon’s scientists and engineers for assassination, and partnered with the U.S. to destroy Iranian nuclear enrichment systems via digital strikes. Saudi Arabia is involved in proxy wars with Iran from Yemen to Lebanon, Afghanistan and Syria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While U.S. officials often talk publicly about working jointly against Iran with Saudi Arabia or Israel, there is rarely any public discussion about such joint action between Israel and Saudi Arabia. But the president’s nuclear deal with Iran has provoked strong opposition in Riyadh and Tel Aviv. Relations between Obama and his counterparts in Israel and Saudi Arabia have become further strained because of his well-chronicled disdain for Israel’s elected prime minister and his more recent comments that Saudi Arabia needed to “share the neighborhood with Iran.” These developments have left both countries feeling less secure and looking to strengthen their relationships in the region outside of Washington’s sphere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the kingdom and the Jewish state are working together against Iran, and almost certainly doing so independent of the U.S. During a recent trip to Israel with other former senior Obama administration officials, I spoke with Israeli officials who acknowledged that they are in close contact with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states. More than one said quiet security cooperation already is taking place and that there is room to expand this cooperation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to the United States, Prince Turki bin Faisal, and retired Israel Defense Forces Maj. Gen. Yaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sat on a stage together in Washington and expressed their shared distrust of Iran and the importance of cooperation to counter the threat. (Unsurprisingly for an open forum, Prince Turki said Saudi Arabia cannot cooperate with Israel until there is progress on the Israeli-Palestinian front.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might Israeli-Saudi cooperation against Iran look like? It might look like joint efforts to digitally inflict attrition on Iran’s ballistic missile-making capacity, overt sabotage and even targeted attacks against Iranian missile engineers and physicists. It could look like secret, unsanctioned Israeli assistance to Saudi Arabia’s missile defense warning capabilities and intelligence sharing about events in Iran. It could look like joint funding of Iranian opposition groups ranging from civil society organizations to Iranian Azeris seeking more autonomy from Tehran. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama has limited time to stitch together closer U.S.-Israeli-Saudi security cooperation. One way to do it is through stronger rhetorical reassurances that Iran is still viewed as an existential threat to other nations in the region; another option would be secret, tripartite military-to-military, and intelligence-to-intelligence “shuttle diplomacy” to make sharing and joint planning more natural for Israel and Saudi Arabia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should the next U.S. president determine it is in the national interest to foster deeper Israeli-Saudi cooperation, the new president could work to strengthen the relationship by asking Israel to make a genuine step toward acknowledging and engaging on Saudi Arabia’s 2002 Arab-Israeli peace proposal. Absent this, Saudi Arabia will not publicly acknowledge any cooperation with Israel, nor risk deeper security cooperation made public. Should Israel take the necessary steps, the U.S. could convene scientific exchanges between Israel and the Gulf States on topics such as water security that give cover for discussion beyond the peace process, to include areas such as critical infrastructure security and cyberthreat detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi-Israel strategic cooperation against Iran ultimately may prove to be good for the U.S. Undercurrents and pressure tactics are the lifeblood of the region’s geopolitics, so having some more potentially favorable cards in the deck can be good. Furthermore, neither Saudi Arabia nor Israel are likely to stray far from the U.S. Both nations want a restoration of a trusted, preferential relationship with the U.S. It is in their interest and in ours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the current situation does increase the risk that the U.S. will be caught off-guard in the most violent and dangerous corner of the world. Ensuring that the U.S. continues to have the ability to shape events in the region is critical for U.S. security and that requires strong relationships with Israel and Saudi Arabia. History may prove Obama right for his outreach to Iran, but betting on a new future for the Middle East without trusted allies in the region is a risky bet indeed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Todd Rosenblum is president of National Security Outcomes and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. He is a former deputy undersecretary of intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security and acting assistant secretary of defense at the Pentagon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Michelle Obama gets her way on nutrition labels</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/flotus-labeling-crusade-223398</link>
      <description>The final rule has been in the works for more than a decade, but the East Wing has been instrumental in shaping the policy and moving the process forward.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;First lady Michelle Obama Friday unveiled the country's first update to nutrition labels in more than two decades — a move that helps cement her campaign to encourage Americans to eat healthier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Nutrition Facts labels, which will take effect in two years and appear on billions of food packages, for the first time require food companies to list how much sugar they add to their products and suggest a limit for how much added sugar people should consume — two changes vehemently opposed by many food companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the rule is difficult to overstate — labels on products from candy bars and sodas to crackers and cereal, at every point of sale across America, must be overhauled at an estimated cost of $2 billion. And those labels will remind Americans every time they open a package of how much added sugar they are consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Very soon, very soon you will no longer need a microscope, a calculator or a degree in nutrition to figure out whether the food you're buying is actually good for our kids,&amp;quot; Obama said today as she unveiled the new label at a health summit in Washington. &amp;quot;That's a phenomenal achievement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration’s determination to stand its ground on added sugar labeling amid fierce opposition from business groups is a sign the first lady intends to bolster her already substantive food policy legacy in her final months in the East Wing. While the media has often painted Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign as soft and uncontroversial, the first lady has brought enormous pressure to bear on groups like the processed food industry and &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/03/michelle-obama-healthy-eating-school-lunch-food-policy-000066" target="_blank"&gt;notched a series of wins related to what Americans eat&lt;/a&gt;. Those include the administration’s effort to all but ban trans fats, mandate more fruits and vegetables as well as less sugar, salt and fat for the meals served to 30 million school kids, and use government financing to get grocery stores into poor communities that lacked access to healthy food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an enormous accomplishment,” Marion Nestle, an influential food policy advocate, said of the new nutrition labels. Nestle gave the administration credit for not walking back any of the changes, first proposed in February 2014 to industry protests. &amp;quot;This is really hard to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although food companies with less than $10 million in annual sales would have three years to comply, significant pushback is expected. The Nutrition Facts label, described as the most reproduced graphic image in the world, hasn’t changed substantially since it first graced food packages in 1994. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sugar Association, which represents the vast majority of sugar producers, has argued the FDA has no scientific justification for mandating added sugars labeling and that doing so sets “an alarming precedent for this and future product labeling regulations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some in the industry also contend that labeling added sugars is likely to confuse consumers and hinted at the possibility of litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have seen this before — the demonizing of a specific ingredient like fat or cholesterol has not worked in the past,&amp;quot; said Bruce Silverglade, a principal at Olsson Frank Weeda Terman Matz, who has worked for the sugar industry. &amp;quot;It's unfortunate that FDA is following the same old failed approach with its efforts to demonize sugars,&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The agency is on very weak legal ground,&amp;quot; Silverglade added. &amp;quot;One can punch holes in FDA's legal rationale for the labeling of added sugars bigger than the Washington Beltway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final rule, published today by the Food and Drug Administration, has been in the works for more than a decade, but the East Wing has been instrumental in shaping the policy and moving the process forward. The regulation stems from a law Congress passed in 1990 giving FDA the authority to mandate nutrition labels on food packages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama will formally unveil the new labels in a presentation today at the Partnership for a Healthier America summit in Washington. The administration is hoping food companies will reformulate their products to reduce sugar, much like they did when they were required to label trans fat in 2006. Since then, the industry has cut more than 80 percent of trans fat out of processed food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design of the new labels won't look radically different. The first thing consumers are likely to notice is that calories are listed in a much larger and bolder font, a change to make it easier for those on the go to spot how many calories are in a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard serving sizes for many foods are also being updated so they align more closely with how much people actually eat — in some cases, significantly larger portions than they are used to seeing fat and caloric breakdowns for. A pint of ice cream, for example, has for decades been labeled as four servings. Under the new rule, a pint will be labeled as roughly three servings — a move that could surprise consumers because it will increase the amount of fat, sugar or calories listed per serving by about a third. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rule also makes changes to which nutrients have to be included on the label. Vitamins A and C will no longer be mandated (Americans mostly get enough of them), but now Vitamin D and potassium will be listed along with calcium and iron. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandating that companies disclose added sugars and list a new percent Daily Value for added sugars, however, are without question the most controversial elements of the final rule. The food industry has long pointed to the fact that science shows people process added sugars and naturally occurring sugars the same way and argued there is no reason to single them out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how willing groups like the Sugar Association may be to get tangled in a long and high-profile legal battle, especially opposite a popular first lady. The association is also just coming off of a long, bruising and expensive legal fight against the Corn Refiners Association over the image of sugar vs. corn syrup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trade group, which represents the vast majority of sugar producers, released a blistering critique Friday: &amp;quot;The extraordinary contradictions and irregularities, as well as the lack of scientific justification in this rulemaking process are unprecedented for the FDA,&amp;quot; it said in a &lt;a href="http://portal.criticalimpact.com/vm2/74f98139779664d5/25838/60b7e0cfbc74232b09e5cb74f1f037a9" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;We are concerned that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent that is not grounded in science, and could actually deter us from our shared goal of a healthier America.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents giant companies such as General Mills and Coca Cola, had a far more tepid reaction despite its earlier opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because consumers could be confused by the new label with its numerous changes, a robust consumer education effort will be needed to ensure that people continue to understand how the revised label can be used to make informed choices and maintain healthful dietary practices,&amp;quot; the association said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all food companies are opposed to listing added sugars. Mars and Nestl&amp;eacute;, two leading global food companies, have come out in support of mandatory labeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We really applaud this,” said Brad Figel, vice president of public affairs at Mars. “We think this is a major step forward in giving consumers more transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think the science is established and that’s why we’re supporting it,” Figel added. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines and the World Health Organization have urged people to not get more than 10 percent of their calories from added sugars, which is along the lines of what FDA is recommending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That recommended limit comes out to be about 50 grams of sugar a day. A regular Pepsi, for example, has 69 grams of sugar, so it would have to be listed has having 138 percent of the Daily Value for added sugars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health groups, including the Academy of Nutrition of Dietetics and the Center for Science in the Public Interest, are also cheering the new label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clear, easy-to-understand food labels will help put Americans on the path to healthy eating,&amp;quot; said Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nestle (no relation to the company), said she is particularly pleased about the large calorie labeling and added sugars mandate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sugars have been hidden in foods for far too long and now they’re going to be out in the open,” she said. “That’s a good thing. I think for people who read the labels, the information is going to come as a big surprise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Top adviser: Obama will keep low political profile out of office</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/what-will-obama-do-after-presidency-223406</link>
      <description/>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Though President Barack Obama is staying in Washington after he leaves the White House in January, the soon-to-be-former president will emulate his predecessors in keeping a lower profile in terms of weighing in on issues of presidential importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a clip from a forthcoming &amp;quot;60 Minutes&amp;quot; story aired Friday on &amp;quot;CBS This Morning,&amp;quot; senior adviser Valerie Jarrett was asked by Norah O'Donnell what it would be like to have the former president and his successor living in the same city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;President Obama will be the former president. And he'll be a citizen just like everybody else. And he'll behave accordingly. Of that, I'm sure,&amp;quot; Jarrett said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Donnell queried, &amp;quot;Meaning what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarrett responded, &amp;quot;One of the things that I would compliment President [George W.] Bush for is — and not just President Bush, but several members of his team as well, who have said to me, we had our eight years, and now we owe you our silence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And I think that's just the way the president will behave in terms of Washington. But does that mean that he has a platform on which he can do great good around our country and around the world? Sure,&amp;quot; Jarrett said. &amp;quot;But he will leave being the president to the new president.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Obama rushes out rules to guarantee legacy</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/obama-rushes-out-rules-to-guarantee-legacy-223301</link>
      <description>The rush is designed to prevent a President Trump from undoing his actions.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration is shoveling out regulations nearly one-third faster in its final year than during the previous three — all to beat a May 23 deadline to prevent a President Donald Trump from overturning them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of &lt;a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/Utilities/index.jsp" target="_blank"&gt;195 regulations&lt;/a&gt; have been pushed through since Jan. 1 &lt;a href="http://www.americanactionforum.org/week-in-regulation/week-regulation-day/" target="_blank"&gt;at an estimated cost of $69.5 billion to the nation’s businesses&lt;/a&gt;, according to the conservative American Action Forum. One of the most significant — a sweeping rule that will extend overtime pay to more than 4 million people without any input from Congress — was released Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This regulatory onslaught has only gotten worse in the administration’s final months,” complained Rep. John Kline (R.-Minn.), who chairs the House committee on Education and the Workforce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whoosh of final rules on everything from e-cigarette use to greenhouse gas emissions exceeds the pace during the same period in the Clinton administration. The goal is to deny Trump the opportunity to kill those regulations under an expedited process should he be elected president and Congress remain in Republican control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama has used his regulatory authority in the face of a hostile Congress to edge the country closer toward the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, for instance, by readying the first methane regulation of the oil and gas industry. He’s also pushing the country leftward on a long-sought labor wish list by enacting a rule protecting workers from silica dust as well as by broadening access to overtime pay — measures that Democrats have been unable to push through a Republican-controlled Congress. The rules may seem arcane in many cases, but their impact is often large, prompting fierce (and in most instances unsuccessful) resistance from lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the nation’s second president, John Adams, lame-duck presidents have used their last days in office to impose their agendas on successors. But only since George W. Bush has there been a rush to complete regulations fully six months before Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blame the Congressional Review Act. Enacted by a newly Republican Congress in 1996 as part of Newt Gingrich’s Contract With America, the CRA law gave Congress 60 legislative days after a regulation was issued to block it by using an expedited procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always part of the calculation,” said Michael Hancock, former assistant administrator for policy at the Labor Department’s wage and hour division, “because it can obviously impact all of the work that’s been done on a fairly complex regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aimed at taming the regulatory leviathan, the law proved almost entirely ineffective because presidents could — and did — routinely veto resolutions of disapproval against their own agencies’ rules. But under one circumstance, the CRA could be deadly. Late in a president’s final year, 60 legislative days (which extend much longer than calendar days) could carry over into another administration. A new president of the opposite party would be tempted to squelch a predecessor’s pet project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That reality was brought home in March 2001, when Bush used the CRA to kill an &lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/FedReg_osha_pdf/FED20001114.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;ergonomics rule&lt;/a&gt; issued by Bill Clinton three months earlier. The rule, aimed at reducing repetitive-motion and other musculoskeletal hazards in the workplace, had been in the works since the presidency of Bush’s father. Declaring the rule “unduly burdensome and overly broad,” Bush sent it packing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bush was careful not to get caught in the same trap himself seven years later. His administration pushed through 214 rules in the first five months of his final year in office — 19 more than the Obama administration for the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimating the deadline is necessarily inexact: In February, the Congressional Research Service &lt;a href="http://src.bna.com/cAk" target="_blank"&gt;calculated&lt;/a&gt; that any rule the Obama administration finalized after May 16 might be reversed. Changes to the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/days-in-session" target="_blank"&gt;legislative calendar&lt;/a&gt; pushed the deadline back to May 23. The addition of a lame-duck session could push the deadline into June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t know what the magic date is until the session is over,” said Hancock. “You do the best you can to project out when it’s going to carry over to the next term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant action undertaken by Obama’s Labor Department, the overtime rule will double (to $47,500) the threshold under which virtually all employees qualify automatically for time-and-a-half pay whenever they work more than 40 hours in any given week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulation is expected to increase the number of workers eligible for overtime pay by more than 4 million by the Labor Department’s reckoning; the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute calculates the number affected at &lt;a href="http://www.epi.org/blog/restoring-overtime-will-benefit-millions-of-working-people/" target="_blank"&gt;more than 12 million&lt;/a&gt;. These workers will receive either wage hikes or reduced hours (itself a kind of raise when wages remain constant). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPI Vice President Ross Eisenbrey says it's “a significant step forward in the effort to boost wages for working people,” but Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, &lt;a href="https://www.uschamber.com/above-the-fold/overtime-rule-would-hurt-more-help" target="_blank"&gt;calls it&lt;/a&gt; “a ham-handed effort to impose its will on America’s job creators” that will “mean fewer opportunities for growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other controversial rules that the Labor Department has already pushed out in advance of the Congressional Review Act deadline concern pensions and the mineral quartz, an important industrial material commonly used in construction and other industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called &lt;a href="http://webapps.dol.gov/FederalRegister/PdfDisplay.aspx?DocId=28806" target="_blank"&gt;“fiduciary” or “conflict of interest” rule&lt;/a&gt;, released in early April, requires brokers who advise clients on their retirement accounts to consider only their clients’ best financial interest. That’s a standard most investors assumed their brokers were following all along, but in fact brokers were previously permitted to modify their advice according to the availability of certain brokerage fees and commissions. The final version of the rule was altered to allow brokerage fees under certain circumstances, provided the broker made certain disclosures to the customer. According to the Labor Department, the cost of complying with the fiduciary rule will approach $2 billion per year, but the benefits to investors will exceed $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a month of the final rule’s announcement the House of Representatives voted along party lines, 234 to 183, to block it under the CRA. A resolution was also introduced in the Senate by Republican Sens. Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Mike Enzi of Wyoming. But Obama says he’ll veto it, underscoring the futility of the CRA when a regulation is finalized outside the 60-legislative-day window. To prevail, Congress would have to override his veto, and the votes just aren’t there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department’s &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/03/25/2016-04800/occupational-exposure-to-respirable-crystalline-silica" target="_blank"&gt;silica rule&lt;/a&gt;, which affects primarily the construction industry, reduced the allowable exposure limit to silica dust to a level first recommended by the Centers for Disease Control in 1974. The &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/03/the-regulation-that-took-four-decades-to-finalize-000078" target="_blank"&gt;very ubiquity of silica &lt;/a&gt;— better known as quartz, it constitutes 12 percent of the earth’s crust — made it exceptionally difficult to regulate, but silica’s well-documented dire health effects drove the effort. (Silicosis has killed more than 2,000 Americans since the start of the 21st century.) When the final rule was released in late March it satisfied neither business groups, which called the Labor Department’s $1 billion estimate of compliance costs too low, nor labor groups which said the exposure limit was still too high. &lt;a href="http://www.nam.org/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2016/04/Manufacturers-to-Fight-Fundamentally-Flawed-Silica-Rule/" target="_blank"&gt;Both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://documents.nam.org/Law/Silica%20motion%20to%20intervene.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;sides&lt;/a&gt; have challenged the final rule in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another regulation that satisfied neither pro-regulatory groups nor the antis was the &lt;a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-10/pdf/2016-10685.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;e-cigarette rule&lt;/a&gt; that the Food and Drug Administration finalized earlier this month. The rule, which would ban minors from “vaping,” would cost the private sector $35 million to $75 million, according to the administration. Compared to the Labor Department rules, that’s a modest price tag, but minors are thought to represent a large portion of the current market; &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/tables/trends/infographics/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Centers for Disease Control, in 2015 the number of hig- schoolers and middle-schoolers who vaped was 3 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry advocates said the rule would put much of the e-cigarette industry at risk. It would “yank responsibly manufactured vapor products from the hands of adult smokers and replace them with the tobacco cigarettes they had been trying to give up,” &lt;a href="https://www.nicopure.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FINAL-VTA-FDA-Release_4-14-16-002.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to Tony Abboud, national legislative director for the Vapor Technology Association. Meanwhile the Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-smoking nonprofit, thought the rule didn’t do enough to limit the marketing of e-cigarettes to minors. “It does nothing to restrict the irresponsible marketing of e-cigarettes or the use of sweet e-cigarette flavors such as gummy bear and cotton candy,” &lt;a href="http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press_releases/post/2016_05_05_ecig" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the group’s president, Matthew Myers, “despite the FDA’s own data showing that flavors play a major role in the skyrocketing youth use of e-cigarettes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Transportation Department, meanwhile, clarified in March that e-cigarettes were covered by its smoking ban on airplanes. At the prompting of GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, however, it did not extend the ban to medical devices such as nebulizers, which allow sufferers of respiratory diseases to inhale medication in aerosol form. Hunter is himself a vaper, and &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/11/politics/duncan-hunter-vaping-congressman-plane-amendment/" target="_blank"&gt;demonstrated its use&lt;/a&gt; during a February hearing on the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has declared global warming to be “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/418542137899491328?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;,” and recently asked Rep. Kevin Cramer (R.-N.D.), a climate-change skeptic, to advise his campaign. That’s reason enough for the Environmental Protection Agency to hustle out this month its first methane regulation for the oil and gas industry, following through on Obama’s plan to cut the U.S. emissions of the potent greenhouse gas by 45 percent over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulations are expected to be rolled out in stages, with the first set confined to methane emissions from new or modified drilling oil and gas drilling sites. The industry opposed these even though it is expected to have little difficulty meeting them — and even though it may even benefit economically from the regulation. Methane is the main component of natural gas, so leaks are essentially money escaping into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas producers are more worried about regulations that EPA has said it would like to start on, forcing the companies to upgrade the vast network of existing gas wells, lines and processing plants. But these haven’t even been proposed yet, making them easy to shred should a President Trump so choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lauren Gardner and Matt Daily contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>GOP elite line up behind Donald Trump</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/gop-elite-line-up-behind-donald-trump-223394</link>
      <description>‘It’s a pretty simple calculus: Do you want to win or do you want to lose?’ one operative says.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Never Trump moment is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a small group of Republicans has wrung its hands raw over the choice between the GOP’s nominee and Hillary Clinton, the party’s firmament – social and intellectual conservatives, the lobbyist and donor class, powerful operatives and outside groups – is increasingly getting in line behind Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never mind that many of them complain about his bombastic and unpredictable political style. The thawing has slowly but surely begun - and it’s visible everywhere -- from mega-donors like Foster Friess rallying Republican governors to Trump, to Mitt Romney’s allies agreeing to raise money for him, to leaders of the Never Trump movement conceding their cause is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am slow-walking the Donald Trump candidacy. It’s a very deliberative process. You can’t beat Hillary Clinton with nothing, and the question is can we fundamentally energize conservatives quickly and can we use our joint desires to unite to find a path forward,” said Ken Blackwell, a former ambassador in the George W. Bush White House and key figure in conservative circles who formerly advised an anti-Trump super PAC. “That’s very methodically playing out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest sea change may be taking place in the donor world. During the primary, Trump put Republican Party benefactors on notice, arguing they had far too much influence and pledging that he wouldn’t court and woo them – an attack that left many of them with a bad taste in their mouths. Yet, as they ponder the prospect of another Clinton presidency, many of the GOP’s most wealthy figures are drawing up plans to finance Trump’s campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While attending a Republican Governors Association retreat in New Mexico this week, Foster Friess, a Wyoming investor who has given million to GOP candidates and causes over the years, announced that he would get behind the New York businessman, according to two people present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Trump’s our nominee. We’ve got to support him,” Friess, the primary funder of Rick Santorum’s 2012 presidential bid, told a group of governors, operatives, and donors. “He’s better than Hillary, and I’m encouraging everyone to support him.” (Neither Friess nor a spokesman would comment.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are getting involved. Andy Beal, a poker-playing Dallas investor whose net worth is said to top $11 billion, is expected to attend a June political briefing that’s being sponsored by a pro-Trump super PAC. And a team of influential donors, including former Republican National Committee finance chairs Elliott Broidy, Ron Weiser, and Ray Washburne, are expected to help raise money for a Trump fundraising committee that was established this week with the national party. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that he’s the nominee, there’s a gradual recognition and understanding that we’re going to be helpful to him,” said Tom Tellefsen, a Los Angeles investor who was a major fundraiser on Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tellefsen, who helped Marco Rubio in the primary, acknowledged that many remained uncomfortable with Trump but said most big GOP donors would come around. He predicted that even those loyal to Romney, a loud Trump critic, would eventually open their wallets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no doubt that he’s substantially different than any candidate that we’ve supported, and that’s a reality at play,” said Tellefsen, who is considering attending a Trump fundraiser being held next week in Southern California. “There’s plenty of time for people to look at him and for him to present himself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some well-funded Republican groups are considering sitting out the presidential race – notably, those overseen by billionaires Charles and David Koch - others see an avenue for getting involved. The Karl Rove-founded American Crossroads, for example, is considering whether to invest in the contest, according to one source familiar with the group’s planning. It has been encouraged by recent polling showing Trump competitive with Clinton nationally and in some swing states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Law, the group’s president and chief executive officer, said the chief focus remained on preserving the GOP’s Senate majority. But he said American Crossroads is also “analyzing what our role needs to be” in the presidential race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the party’s most prominent operatives, who spent months warning about the perils of his candidacy, are warming, too. During this week’s RGA meeting, Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist who spent part of last year pitching donors on an anti-Trump TV campaign, delivered a presentation in which he argued that the New York businessman has a better than 50 percent chance of winning. The general election, he predicted, would be exceedingly negative – an environment Trump would prosper in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump campaign, meanwhile, is taking steps to court movement conservatives – a critical constituency which has long feared that Trump’s nomination would cause irreparable damage to their&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;cause. Before introducing a list of possible Supreme Court picks this week, Trump’s advisers sought input from groups including the Judicial Crisis Network and the Heritage Foundation – a move designed to curry favor on an issue of great importance to social and intellectual conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, it worked. Penny Nance, the president of Concerned Women for America, a leading evangelical group, has long been a Trump skeptic. Last year, she approached possible donors to gauge support for an anti-Trump campaign. Then, in January, she signed a letter to Iowa caucus-goers urging them to “support anyone but Donald Trump,” and warning that he would be deeply adversarial to the evangelical cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as Nance scrutinizes Trump’s Supreme Court possibilities, she sees a path to supporting him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s helpful,” she said. “I’m still looking at all the names but this is the key issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is also winning praise for reassuring conservatives that he will not look to interfere with their desire to craft an official platform at the July convention that deviates from traditional GOP orthodoxy. His policy advisers, including anti-abortion activist John Mashburn, have begun reaching out to The National Republican Platform Project, a newly-formed organization that is focused on establishing a conservative platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The courtship is paying dividends. Two people involved in Conservatives Against Trump, a group that is devoted to finding a third-party candidate, said that as many as a dozen members had recently departed, convinced that its efforts were futile. The organization, which was co-founded by  conservative commentator Erick Erickson and has been holding regular conference calls to discuss ways to derail Trump, suffered a blow when its favored would-be-candidate, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, took himself out of contention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deborah DeMoss Fonseca, a Conservatives Against Trump spokeswoman, disputed the figure, saying only a handful had left and that others had recently joined. The group, she insisted, had seen “new intensity in recent days.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, as people get used to Trump being the nominee, many believe it’s only a matter of time before holdouts get on board – if for no other reason than their dislike of Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a pretty simple calculus: Do you want to win or do you want to lose?” said American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp, who was a political adviser in the Bush White House. “It’s inevitable that the vast majority of people will support him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Sanders outraised Clinton in April after all</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-april-fundraising-223427</link>
      <description>New FEC reports contradict earlier claims, but also show Clinton building towards the general election.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton entered this month with a healthy $30 million in the bank, but her campaign did not take in more money than Bernie Sanders' in April, contradicting earlier &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/hillary-clinton-april-fundraising-totals-222695" target="_blank"&gt;assessments&lt;/a&gt; and calling into question suggestions that her fundraising had overtaken his small-dollar fundraising juggernaut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton’s main campaign committee directly received $25.1 million last month, compared with $26.9 million raised by Sanders’ campaign, according to &lt;a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00575795/1073673/" target="_blank"&gt;reports filed Friday&lt;/a&gt; afternoon with the &lt;a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00577130/1073715/" target="_blank"&gt;Federal Election Commission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders’ actual tally is slightly more than his campaign indicated earlier this month, when it put out a news release boasting of raising $25.8 million. A Sanders campaign source said the discrepancy resulted from the challenges of tallying huge numbers of small donations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Clinton’s tally is slightly less than the $26.4 million that her campaign touted earlier this month. The discrepancy in her fundraising figures arises from the accounting techniques of a joint committee called the Hillary Victory Fund that her campaign formed with the Democratic National Committee and 32 state parties. In addition to the $4 million transferred by the Hillary Victory Fund to Clinton’s campaign committee, Clinton’s aides counted toward its April tally $1.8 million in expenses paid out by the fund for the Clinton campaign’s share of joint fundraising costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those funds were spent on behalf of her campaign, even though the money that paid for them was never transferred to the campaign, the Clinton campaign says. It has been assessing its finances that way since the formation of the victory fund last year, a spokesman said, rejecting a suggestion that it’s an effort to pad its bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in April, the higher tally that resulted from the accounting method led to a &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/01/politics/bernie-sanders-26-million-fundraising-april/" target="_blank"&gt;slew&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/278350-clinton-fundraises-264m-for-april" target="_blank"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt;, including in &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/hillary-clinton-april-fundraising-totals-222695" target="_blank"&gt;POLITICO&lt;/a&gt;, about Clinton outraising Sanders for the first time, which was seen as significant since Sanders’ small-dollar online fundraising prowess has been a key advantage over Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sanders still raised much more than Clinton from small donors in April ($11 million to $5.5 million), his overall fundraising dropped substantially from the previous two months, as Clinton closed in on the Democratic Party nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton’s campaign appeared to be preparing for the general election, spending far less than Sanders. She dropped $23.9 million in April, compared with $38.6 million for him. Sanders spent almost twice as much on media and payroll (despite a slightly smaller staff), as well as more on online advertising and direct mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Sanders entered this month with only $5.8 million in the bank, much less than Clinton’s $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton also made slight inroads with small donors who have favored her rival: 22 percent of the contributions to the campaign in April were in amounts less than $200, compared with 19 percent across the cycle. About 17 percent of her total income came from donors who hit the $2,700 limit and can't give again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And Clinton's campaign raised an additional $9.5 million for various Democratic Party committees through the victory fund, though it has been &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/04/sanders-clinton-dnc-campaign-finance-laws-222102" target="_blank"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; for purporting to help rebuild state parties while actually funneling cash to the DNC. The state parties in South Carolina, Arkansas and Tennessee reported receiving $176,000 each from the victory fund on April 25 but transferring the same amount to the DNC on the same day, continuing an &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670" target="_blank"&gt;earlier pattern of shuffling funds&lt;/a&gt;. The Georgia Democrats transferred $176,000 to the DNC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders also has a joint fundraising committee but hasn't used it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Erick Erickson: 'I think the time has come for Mitt Romney'</title>
      <link>http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/erick-erickson-mitt-romney-223420</link>
      <description/>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Not only does Erick Erickson want Mitt Romney to restart a search for a third-party candidate to challenge Donald Trump, he also wants Romney to consider being that person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conservative blogger &lt;a href="http://theresurgent.com/mitt-romney-should-reconsider-a-third-party-bid/" target="_blank"&gt;wrote for The Resurgent&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that he would &amp;quot;gladly work for a Romney Presidency given the choices between&amp;quot; Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erickson, who has said he would never vote for Trump, opposed Romney during his previous presidential runs. On Wednesday, Yahoo News reported that Romney has ruled out an independent bid for president and is not trying to get any other Republicans to take up the mantle despite remaining hopeful for someone else to surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I opposed Romney in 2008 and 2012, but I think the time has come for Mitt Romney,&amp;quot; Erickson wrote. &amp;quot;I can’t believe I’m even writing this. But seriously, Mitt Romney should run for President again and transcend party for the good of the country.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney has also refused to back the presumptive Republican nominee, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/mittromney/posts/10153487016861121" target="_blank"&gt;attacking&lt;/a&gt; Trump for refusing to release his tax returns and previously &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/mittromney/posts/10153370698696121" target="_blank"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;Trumpism has become associated with racism, misogyny, bigotry, xenophobia, vulgarity and, most recently, threats and violence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content:encoded>
